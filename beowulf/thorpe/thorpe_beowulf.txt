Ay, we _the_ Gar-Danes’,
in days of yore,
_the_ great kings’,
renown have heard of:
how those princes
valour display’d.
Oft Scyld Scef’s son
from bands of robbers,
from many tribes,
_their_ mead-benches drag’d away:	[10]
inspired earls with fear,
after _he_ first was
found destitute:
he thence look’d for comfort,
flourished under _the_ clouds,
in dignities throve,
until him every one
of those sitting around
over _the_ whale-road
must obey,	[20]
tribute pay:
that was _a_ good king!
To him _a_ son was		{1/2}
afterwards born,
_a_ young _one_ in _his_ courts,
whom God sent
for comfort to _the_ people:
_he the_ dire need felt
that they ere had suffered
_while_ princeless,	[30]
for _a_ long while.
To him therefore _the_ Lord of life,
Prince of glory,
gave worldly honour.
Beowulf was renown’d,
the glory widely sprang
of Scyld’s offspring
in _the_ Scanian lands:
So shall _a_ warlike chief
work with good,	[40]
with bounteous money-gifts,
in _his_ paternal home,
that it in _his_ age
again inhabit
_his_ welcome comrades;
_and_ when war comes,
for _the_ people act:
by praiseworthy deeds shall,
in every tribe,
a man flourish.	[50]
Scyld then departed		{2/3}
at _his_ fated time,
_the_ much strenuous, to go
into _the_ Lord’s keeping.
They him then bore away
to _the_ sea-shore,
his dear companions,
as he had himself enjoin’d
while with words had sway
_the_ Scyldings’ friend;	[60]
_the_ beloved land’s chief
had long possessed _it_.
There at _the_ hithe stood
_the_ ring-prow’d _ship_
icy and eager to depart,
_the_ prince’s vehicle.
_They_ laid then
_the_ beloved chief,
_the_ dispenser of rings,
in _the_ ship’s bosom,	[70]
_the_ great _one_ by _the_ mast:
there were treasures many
from far ways,
ornaments brought.
I have not heard of _a_ comelier
keel adorn’d
with war-weapons
and martial weeds,
with glaves and byrnies.
On his bosom lay	[80]
treasures many,
which were with him _to_ go
into _the_ flood’s possession,
far depart.		{3/4}
They him not with less
gifts provided,
lordly treasures,
than they did,
who him at _the_ beginning
sent forth	[90]
alone o’er _the_ wave,
being _a_ child.
They moreover set
_a_ golden ensign
high o’er _his_ head;
let _the_ sea bear _him_,
gave _him_ to ocean.
Their mind was sad,
mourning _their_ mood:
men cannot	[100]
say for sooth,
counsellors in hall,
heroes under heaven,
who that lading received.		{4/5}	I.
Then was in _the_ towns
Beowulf, _the_ Scyldings’
beloved sovereign
for _a_ long time,
fam’d among nations:
(_his_ father had passed away,	[110]
the prince from _his_ dwelling),
until from him in turn sprang forth
_the_ lofty Healfdene;
_he_ ruled while _he_ liv’d,
old and war-fierce,
_the_ glad Scyldings.
From him four children
numbered forth
sprang in _the_ world,
heads of hosts,	[120]
Heorogar and Hrothgar
and Halga _the_ good
* * *
I have heard that Ela’s queen,
_the_ martial Scylfing’s
bed-partaker.
* * *
Then was to Hrothgar
martial prowess given,
warlike glory,	[130]	{5/6}
_so_ that him his dear kinsmen
willingly obey’d,
until the youth grew up,
_a_ great kindred train.
_It_ ran through his mind
that [he] _a_ hall-house
would command,
_a_ great mead-house,
men to make,
which _the_ sons of men	[140]
should ever hear of;
and there within
all distribute
to young and old,
as to him God had given,
except _the_ people’s share,
and _the_ lives of men.
Then I heard _that_ widely
_the_ work _was_ proclaim’d
to many _a_ tribe	[150]
through this mid-earth,
that _a_ public place was building.
Him _it_ in time befel,
soon among men,
that it was all ready,
of hall-houses greatest.
Gave it _the_ name of Heort,
he who power of his word
widely had.		{6/7}
He belied not _his_ promise,	[160]
bracelets distributed,
treasure at _the_ feast.
_The_ hall rose
high and horn-curv’d;
heat intense awaited _it_
of hostile flame.
Nor was it yet long,
when the warrior promis’d
with oaths to swear,
_that_ after from deadly enmity	[170]
_he_ would cease.
Then the potent guest
with difficulty
for a time endur’d,
(he who in darkness dwelt,)
that he each day
heard merriment
loud in _the_ hall.
There was sound of harp,
loud _the_ gleeman’s song	[180]
he said, who could
_the_ origin of men
from far _back_ relate,
told that the Almighty
wrought _the_ earth,
_the_ plain in beauty bright,
which water embraces;
set, in victory exulting,
sun and moon,
beams for light	[190]
to _the_ dwellers on land,
and adorn’d		{7/8}
earth’s regions
with boughs and leaves:
life eke created
for every kind
of those that quick go to and fro.
Thus the retainers
lived in delights
happily,	[200]
till that one began
crime to perpetrate,
_a_ fiend in hell.
The grim guest was
Grendel hight,
_the_ great traverser of _the_ mark,
that held _the_ moors,
_the_ fen and fastness;
_the_ Fifel-race’s dwelling
_the_ unbless’d man	[210]
inhabited _a_ while,
after _the_ Creator him
had proscribed.
On Cain’s race
that death avenged
_the_ eternal Lord,
for that he Abel slew,
He joy’d not in that enmity,
for he him far banish’d,
the Creator for that crime	[220]
from mankind.
Thence monstrous births
all sprang forth,
eotens, and elves,		{8/9}
and orkens,
so likewise _the_ giants,
who against God war’d
for a long space:
He for that gave them _their_ reward.			II.
_He_ departed then to visit,	[230]
after night had come,
_the_ lofty house,
how it _the_ Ring-Danes,
after _their_ beer potation,
had occupied.
_He_ then found therein
_a_ company of nobles
sleeping after _their_ feast ;
sorrow _they_ knew not,
misery of men,	[240]
aught of unhappiness.
Grim and greedy,
_he_ was soon ready,
rugged and fierce,
and in _their_ rest took
thirty thanes :
thence again departed,
in _his_ prey exulting,
to _his_ home to go,
with the slaughter’d corpses,	[250]
_his_ quarters to visit.
Then in _the_ morning was,
at early day,
Grendel’s war-craft		{9/10}
to men manifest.
Then was after _the_ repast
_a_ whoop up-rais’d,
_a_ great morning sound.
_The_ great prince,
_the_ noble excellent,	[260]
unblithe sat,
suffered _the_ strong in hosts,
_the_ thane endur’d sorrow,
when they the foe’s
traces beheld,
_the_ accursed sprite’s:
that strife was too strong,
loathsome and tedious.
_It_ was no longer space,
but after one night	[270]
_he_ again perpetrated
greater mortal harms,
and regretted not for
_his_ enmity and crime;
he was too firm in them.
Then was easily found
who elsewhere
more commodiously would rest.
* * *
* * *	[280]
* * *
beds along _the_ bowers,
when _it_ was indicated to him.
Said truly,
by _a_ manifest token,		{10/11}
_the_ hall thane’s hate:
held himself afterwards
farther and faster,
he who from the fiend escap’d.
So _Grendel_ rul’d,	[290]
and against right war’d,
alone against all,
until empty stood
of houses best.
Great was the while,
twelve winters’ tide
_his_ rage endur’d
_the_ Scyldings’ friend,
every woe,
ample sorrows;	[300]
for it [after] became
to _the_ children of men
openly known,
sadly in songs,
that Grendel war’d
awhile ’gainst Hrothgar,
waged hateful enmities,
crime and hostility,
for many years,
incessant strife;	[310]
peace would not _have_
with any man
of _the_ Danes’ power,
_or_ mortal bale withdraw
with money compromise;		{11/12}
nor there any wight
might hope for
_a_ lighter penalty
at _the_ murderer’s hands.
_The_ fell wretch	[320]
was persecuting,
_the_ dark death shade,
noble and youthful,
oppress’d and snar’d _them_.
In perpetual night _he_ held
_the_ misty moors.
Men know not
whither hell-sorcerers
at times wander
Thus many crimes	[330]
_the_ foe of mankind,
_the_ fell solitary,
oft perpetrated,
cruel injuries.
Heorot _he_ occupied,
_the_ seat richly variegated,
in _the_ dark nights:
not the gift-seat he
might touch,
_that_ treasure, for _the_ Lord’s _protection_,	[340]
nor his design knew:
that was _a_ great marvel!
_The_ Scylding’s friend,
in spirit broken,		{12/13}
many _a_ time sat,
_the_ powerful _one_ in deliberation,
counsel they devis’d,
what for _the_ strong-soul’d
_it_ were best,
against _the_ perilous horrors,	[350]
to accomplish.
Sometimes they promis’d,
at _the_ temples,
idolatrous honours;
in words prayed,
that them _the_ spirit-slayer
would aid afford
against _the_ great afflictions.
Such was their custom,
_the_ heathens’ hope;	[360]
hell _they_ remember’d
in _their_ mind,
_the_ Creator they knew not,
_the_ Judge of deeds,
they knew not _the_ Lord God,
nor, indeed, _the_ heavens’ Protector
knew they how to praise,
Glory’s Ruler.
Woe shall be to him who shall
through cruel malice,	[370]
thrust _a_ soul
into _the_ fire’s embrace;
of comfort let _him_ not expect
aught to betide _him_.		{13/14}
Well shall _it_ be to him who may,
after _his_ death-day,
seek _the_ Lord,
and in _his_ Father’s bosom
desire peace.			III.
So then _a_ time of care	[380]
Healfdene’s son
constantly seeth’d;
_the_ sagacious hero could not
_the_ calamity avert:
the strife was too strong,
loathsome and tedious,
that had come on the people;
force-misery with malice grim,
of night-evils greatest.
When from home had heard	[390]
Hygelac’s thane,
(_a_ good _man_ among _the_ Goths,)
of Grendel’s deeds;
who of mankind was
in power strongest
in that day
of this life,
noble and vigorous,
_he_ bade for him a wave-traverser
good be prepar’d;	[400]
said _that_ he _the_ war-king
over _the_ swan-road
would seek,
_the_ renowned prince,		{14/15}
as he had need of men.
That voyage to him
prudent men
somewhat blam’d,
though he was dear to them;
* * *	[410]
* * *
* * *
_they_ whetted _the_ renowned _chief_,
observed _the_ omen;
the good _chief_ had
of _the_ Goths’ people
chosen champions,
of those whom he _the_ bravest
could find;
with some fifteen	[420]
_the_ floating wood _he_ sought.
_A_ warrior pointed out,
_a_ water-crafty man,
_the_ land-boundaries.
_A_ time passed on,
_the_ floater was on _the_ waves,
_the_ boat under _the_ mountain;
_the_ ready warriors
on _the_ prow stept;
_the_ streams roll’d	[430]
_the_ sea against _the_ sand;
_the_ warriors bare,
into _the_ bark’s bosom,
bright arms,		{15/16}
_a_ sumptuous war-equipment:
_the_ men shov’d out,
_the_ people, on _the_ welcome voyage,
_the_ bound wood.
Departed then o’er _the_ wavy sea.
by _the_ wind impell’d,	[440]
_the_ floater foamy-neck’d,
to _a_ bird most like,
till that about an hour
of _the_ second day
_the_ twisted prow
had sail’d,
_so_ that the voyagers
saw land,
_the_ ocean-shores shine,
mountains steep,	[450]
spacious sea-nesses.
Then was _the_ sea-sailer
at _the_ end of _its_ watery way.
Thence up quickly
_the_ Weders’ people
stept on _the_ plain;
_the_ sea-wood tied,
_their_ _mail-_shirts shook,
_their_ martial weeds;
_they_ thanked God,	[460]
for that to them the wave-paths
had been easy.
When from _the_ wall saw
_the_ Scyldings’ warder,		{16/17}
who _the_ sea-shores
had to keep,
borne o’er _the ship’s_ bulwark
bright shields,
_a_ war-equipment ready,
him curiosity brake	[470]
in _his_ mind’s thoughts,
as _to_ what those men were.
Went then to the shore,
on _his_ horse riding,
Hrothgar’s thane,
violently quak’d
the mighty wood in _his_ hands
in formal words _he_ ask’d:
“What are ye
of arm-bearing _men_,	[480]
with byrnies protected,
who thus _a_ surgy keel
over _the_ water-street
come leading,
hither o’er the seas?
* * *
I for this, placed at the extremity,
sea-ward have held,
that on _the_ Danes’ land
no enemies	[490]
with _a_ ship army
might do injury.
Not here more openly
to come have attempted		{17/18}
shield-bearers,
nor _who the_ credence word
of warriors
ready knew not,
_the_ observances of kinsmen.
Never have I seen _a_ greater	[500]
earl on earth
than is one of you,
_a_ warrior in arms:
that is no man seldom
honour’d in arms,
unless his countenance belie him,
_his_ distinguished aspect.
Now I must your
origin know,
ere ye farther hence,	[510]
_as_ false spies,
into _the_ Danes’ land
further proceed.
Now ye far-dwellers,
sea-farers,
hear my
simple thought:
haste is best
to make known
whence your coming is.”	[520]		IV.
Him the chiefest
answered,		{18/19}
_the_ band’s director
_his_ word-hoard unlock’d:
“We are of race
of _the_ Goths’ nation,
and Hygelac’s
hearth-enjoyers:
my father was
known to nations,	[530]
_a_ noble chieftain,
Ecgtheow hight:
_he_ abode winters many,
ere he on _his_ way departed,
old from _his_ courts:
him well remembers
almost every sage,
widely throughout _the_ earth.
We through kind feeling
thy lord,	[540]
Healfdene’s son,
have come to seek,
_thy_ prince to defend.
Be thou our kind informant.
We have to the illustrious
lord of _the_ Danes
a great errand.
There shall naught secret
be, from what I ween:
thou knowest if it is	[550]
as we soothly
have heard say;
that with _the_ Scyldings
_a_ wretch, I know not who,
_a_ secret deed-hater.		{19/20}
in _the_ dark nights,
displays through terror
unheard of malice,
injury and slaughter.
I for this to Hrothgar may,	[560]
through _my_ capacious mind,
counsel teach,
how he, wise and good,
_the_ foe shall overcome
if to him return
_he_ ever should;
_how_ for _these_ works of bale
reparation _may_ follow,
and those care-boilings
become cooler;	[570]
or he ever after _will_
_a_ time of tribulation,
oppression suffer,
while shall there continue
in _its_ high place
of houses best.”
_The_ warder spake,
where on _his_ horse he sat,
_a_ fearless officer:
“Of both should	[580]
_a_ sharp shield-warrior
_the_ difference know,
of words and works
who well thinks.
I hear,
that is _a_ frendly band
to _the_ Scyldings’ lord:
depart bearing forth		{20/21}
weapons and weeds,
I will direct you:	[590]
in like manner I my
fellow-officers will bid,
against every foe
your ship,
new-tarred,
_your_ bark on _the_ sand,
honourably to hold,
until back shall bear,
over _the_ water-streams,
_the_ beloved man	[600]
_the_ wood twisted neck’d
to _the_ Weder-march,
of _the_ good-doers
to such as _it_ shall be given
that the rush of war
_he_ escape from whole.”
_They_ departed then to go,
_the_ vessel still abode,
lay heavy in _the_ mud
_the_ wide-bosom’d ship,	[610]
at anchor fast.
_A_ boar’s likeness sheen
over _their_ cheeks _they_ bore,
adorn’ d with gold;
variegated and fire-harden’d,
_it_ held life in ward.
_the_ warlike of mood were fierce;
_the_ men hasten’d,
descended together,
until they all-built,	[620]
elegant and with gold variegated,		{21/22}
might perceive
what was _the_ grandest,
to earth’s inhabitants,
of houses under _the_ firmament,
in which the powerful _king_ abode:
_its_ light shone
o’er many lands.
_To_ them then _the_ beast of war
_the_ proud ones’ court	[630]
clearly show’d,
that they might
towards it go.
Of _the_ warriors one
turn’d _his_ steed,
then spake _these_ words:
“Time ’tis for me to go;
_may the_ all-ruling Father
with honour
hold you,	[640]
safe in _your_ fortunes:
I will to _the_ sea _return_,
’gainst _any_ hostile band
to hold ward.”			V.
_The_ street was stone-varied,
_it_ directed _the_ path
to _the_ men together;
_the_ martial byrnie shone,
hard, hand-lock’d;
_the_ ring’d iron bright	[650]
sang in _their_ gear.		{22/23}
even as to _the_ hall they,
in their terrific arms,
came walking.
_The_ sea-weary set
_their_ ample shields,
_their_ disks intensely hard,
against _the_ mansion’s wall.
Stoop’d then to _a_ bench,
_their_ byrnies placed in a ring,	[660]
_the_ war-gear of men;
_the_ javelins stood,
_the_ seamen’s arms,
all together,
_the_ ash-wood grey above:
the iron band was
with weapons furnish’d.
Then there _a_ haughty chief
_the_ sons of conflict
concerning _the_ heroes ask’d:	[670]
“Whence bear ye
_your_ stout shields,
grey sarks,
and visor-helms,
a heap of war-shafts?
I am Hrothgar’s
messenger and servant.
Never saw I stranger
men thus many
prouder.	[680]
I ween that ye for pride,
not for exile,
but for soul-greatness,
have Hrothgar sought.”
Him then _the_ valour-fam’d
answer’d,
_the_ Weders’ proud lord
_these_ words after spake,
_the_ bold under his helmet:
“We are Hygelac’s	[690]
table enjoyers:
Beowulf is my name:
I will relate
to Healfdene’s son,
_the_ great lord,
my errand,
to thy prince ;
if he to us will grant
that we him so good
may greet.”	[700]
Wulfgar spake,
he was _the_ Wendels’ lord:
his mind was
known to many,
_his_ valour and wisdom:
“I therefore _the_ Danes’ friend,
_the_ Scyldings’ lord,
will ask,
_the_ distributor of rings,
as thou requestest,	[710]
_the_ great lord,
concerning thy voyage, and to thee
_the_ answer
quickly make known
that me the good _prince_
shall think _fit_ to give.		{24/25}
_He_ then turn’d hastily
to where Hrothgar sat,
old and hairless,
with his assemblage of earls.	[720]
_The_ valour-fam’d _chief_ went
_so_ that he before the shoulders stood
of _the_ Danes’ lord:
he knew _the_ usage of _a_ court.
Wulfgar spake
to his friendly lord :
“Hither are borne,
come from afar,
over ocean’s course,
people of the Goths;	[730]
the chief
_these_ sons of conflict
name Beowulf.
They are petitioners
that they, my lord,
with thee may
in words converse:
do not decree them _a_ denial.
Of thy reciprocal words
of _the_ pleasure, Hrothgar they,	[740]
in _their_ war-equipments,
appear worthy,
of _the_ estimation of earls :
at least the chief certainly,
who _the_ warriors
has led hither.		{25/26}	VI.
Hrothgar spake,
_the_ Scyldings’ helm:
“I knew him,
being _a_ boy:	[750]
his old father was
Ecgtheow named,
to whom at home gave
Hrethel _lord_ of _the_ Goths.
_his_ only daughter:
is _his_ offspring now,
bold, hither come,
sought _a_ kind friend?
For that said
_the_ sea-voyagers,	[760]
who _the_ gift treasures
for _the_ Goths bore
thither gratuitously,
that he of thirty
men _the_ mighty power,
in his hand-gripe,
_the_ war-fam’d, has.
Him holy God,
in _his_ mercies,
to us hath sent,	[770]
to _the_ West Danes:
therefore have I hope		{26/27}
against Grendel’s horror
I to the good _chief_ shall
for his valorous daring,
treasures offer.
Be thou speedy,
bid _them_ come in,
see _their_ kindred band
assembled together.	[780]
Say to them eke in words
that they are welcome guests
to the Danes’ people.
* * *
* * *
the words announced:
“To you bids _me_ say
my victor-lord,
prince of _the_ East Danes,
that your nobility he knows;	[790]
and _that_ ye are to him,
over _the_ sea-billows
boldly striving
hither, welcome guests.
Now ye may go,
in your war-accoutrements,
under _the_ martial helm,
Hrothgar to see.
Let _your_ war-boards
here await,	[800]
_your_ spears _and_ deadly shafts,
the council of words.”		{27/28}
Arose then the mighty _chief_,
around him many _a_ warrior,
_a_ valiant band of thanes;
some there remain’d,
held _the_ war-weeds,
as them the bold _one_ bade.
They hasten’d together,
to where _the_ warrior directed.	[810]
under Heorot’s roof,
_the_ bold one under helm,
_till_ that on _the_ dais he stood.
Beowulf spake,
on him _his_ byrnie shone,
_his_ war-net sewed
by _the_ smith’s devices.
“Be thou, Hrothgar, hail!
I am Hygelac’s
kinsman and fellow-warrior:	[820]
I have great deeds many
undertaken in _my_ youth.
To me became Grendel’s affair
on my native turf,
manifestly known:
sea-farers say
that this hall stands,
_this_ house most excellent,
for every warrior
void and useless,	[830]
after _the_ evening light
under heaven’s serenity
is conceal’d.		{28/29}
Then me counsel’d
my people,
the most excellent
sagacious men,
prince Hrotligar!
that I thee should seek;
because they of my strength
_the_ power knew.	[841]
Themselves beheld,
when from _their_ snares I came,
blood-stain’d from _the_ foes,
where five I bound;
(_the_ eoten race boil’d _with_ rage)
and on _the_ billows slew
nickers by night;
pinching want _I_ suffer’d:
_I_ aveng’d _the_ Weders’ quarrel;	[850]
(_they_ sought _their_ misery;)
fiercely crush’d _them_;
and _I_ now against Grendel shall,
against that miserable being,
alone hold
council with _the_ giant.
I thee now,
lord of _the_ bright Danes,
will beseech,
protector of _the_ Scyldings,	[860]
one prayer:
that thou deny me not,
patron of warriors,
friend of people,
now I am thus come from far,
that I alone may,		{29/30}
_with_ the company of my earls,
and this bold band,
Heorot purify.
I have also heard	[870]
that the miserable being,
in his heedlessness,
of weapons recks not;
I then will disdain
(so to me may Hygelac be,
my liege lord,
blithe of mood)
to bear _a_ sword
or ample shield,
_a_ yellow disk, to battle;	[880]
but with grasp I shall
grapple with _the_ enemy,
and for life contend,
foe against foe:
there shall trust
in _the_ Lord’s doom,
he whom death shall take.
I ween that he will,
if he may prevail,
in the martial hall,	[890]
_the_ Goths’ people
eat fearlessly,
as he oft has done
_the_ Hrethmen’s strength.
Thou wilt not need my
head to hide;		{30/31}
for he will have me
stain’d with gore,
if me death shall take;
will bear off _my_ bloody corse,	[900]
will resolve to feast on _it_;
_the_ lonely _wretch_ will eat it
without compunction;
_he my_ moor-mound will markout.
Thou needest not about _the_
feeding on my carcase
longer care.
Send to Hygelac,
if _the_ conflict take me _off_,
_the_ best of battle-shrouds,	[910]
that defends my breast,
of vests most excellent;
it is Hrædla’s legacy,
Weland’s work:
fate goes ever as it must.”			VII.
Hrothgar spake,
_the_ Scyldiugs’ helm:
“For battles thou,
my friend Beowulf,
and for honour,	[920]
us hast sought.
Thy father quell’d in fight
_the_ greatest feud:		{31/32}
he was of Heatholaf
_the_ slayer,
with _the_ Wylfings,
when him _the_ Waras’ race,
for martial dread,
might not have.
Thence he sought	[930]
_the_ South Danes’ folk
over _the_ rolling of _the_ waves,
_a_ messenger to _the_ Scyldings,
when I first rul’d
_the_ Danes’ people,
and in youth held
spacious realms,
_the_ treasure-city of men.
Then was Heregar dead,
my elder brother	[940]
not living,
_the_ son of Healfdene;
he was better than I:
afterwards that quarrel
_I_ with money settled;		{32/33}
I sent to _the_ Wylfings,
over _the_ water’s back,
old treasures:
he to me swore oaths.
Sorrow is to me to say,	[950]
in my mind,
to any man,
what for me Grendel has
disgrace in Heorot,
with his hostile devices,
_what_ sudden mischiefs perpetrated.
My court-retainers are,
my martial band, diminished:
them fate has swept away
in horror of Grendel.	[960]
God easily may
the doltish spoiler
from _his_ deeds sever.
Full oft have promis’d,
with beer drunken,
over _the_ ale-cup,
sons of conflict,
that they in _the_ beer-hall
would await
Grendel’s warfare
with terrors of edges:
then was this mead-hall,
at morning-tide,
_this_ princely court, stain’d with gore;
when _the_ day dawn’d,
all _the_ bench-floor
with blood besteam’d,		{33/34}
_the_ hall, with horrid gore:
of faithful _followers_ I own’d the less,
of dear nobles,	[980]
whom then death destroyed.
Sit now to _the_ feast,
and unbind with mead,
_thy_ valiant breast with _my_ warriors,
as thy mind may excite.”
Then was for _the_ sons of _the_ Goths
altogether
in the beer-hall
_a_ bench clear’d:
there _the_ strong of soul	[990]
went to sit
tumultuously rejoicing:
_the_ thane observed _his_ duty,
who in _his_ hand bare
_the_ ornamented ale-cup,
_he_ pour’d _the_ bright, sweet _liquor_;
_the_ gleeman sang at times
serene in Heorot:
there was joy of warriors,
no few nobles,	[1000]
of Danes and Weders.			VIII.
Hunferth spake,
Ecglaf’s son
who at _the_ feet sat
of _the_ Scylding’s lord;		{34/35}
unbound a hostile speech
To him was _the_ voyage of Beowulf,
_the_ bold sea-farer,
_a_ great displeasure;
because he grudged	[1010]
that any other man
ever more glories
of mid-earth
held under heaven
than himself;
“Art thou the Beowulf
who with Breca strove
on _the_ wide sea,
in _a_ swimming strife,
where ye from pride	[1020]
tempted _the_ fords,
and for foolish vaunt
in _the_ deep water
ventured _your_ lives?
Nor you any man,
nor friend nor foe,
might blame
_for your_ sorrowful voyage,
when on _the_ sea ye row’d,
when ye _the_ ocean-stream;	[1030]
with _your_ arms deck’d,
measur’d _the_ sea-ways,
with _your_ hands vibrated _them_,
glided o’er _the_ main;
ocean boil’d with waves,
with winter’s fury:
ye on _the_ water’s domain,		{35/36}
_for_ seven nights toil’d.
He thee in swimming overcame,
_he_ had more strength,
when him at morning tide,
on to Heatho-ræmes
_the_ sea bore up;
whence he sought
_his_ dear country,
_the_ beloved of his people,
_the_ Brondings’ land,
_his_ fair, peaceful burgh,
where he _a_ people own’d,
a burgh and rings.	[1050]
All _his_ promise to thee
Beanstan’s son
truly fulfil’d.
Now I expect from thee
worse things,
though thou in martial onslaughts
hast everywhere excel’d,
in grim war,
if thou to Grendel durst
_a_ night-long space	[1060]
near abide.”
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
“Well! thou _a_ great deal,
my friend Hunferth,
drunken with beer,
hast about Breca spoken,		{36/37}
hast said of his course.
_The_ sooth I tell,
that I strength at sea	[1070]
greater possess’d,
endurance on _the_ waves,
than any other man.
We agreed,
being striplings,
and promised,
(_we_ were both yet
in youthful life,)
that we on _the_ ocean out
_our_ lives would venture,	[1080]
and that we thus accomplish’d.
_We_ had _a_ naked sword,
when on _the_ deep we row’d,
hard in hand:
as we us against _the_ whale-fishes
meant to defend.
He not aught from me
far on _the_ flood-waves
could float,
not in _the_ sea more swiftly;	[1090]
nor would I _go_ from him.
Then we together
were in _the_ sea
_a_ five-nights’ space,
till that _the_ flood drove us asunder;
_the_ boiling fords
_the_ coldest of tempests,
cloudy night,
and _the_ north wind,
deadly grim threw up		{37/38}
rough were the billows,	[1101]
of the sea-fishes was
_the_ rage excited:
there me against _the_ foes
my body-sark,
hard, hand-lock’d,
afforded help;
_my_ braided war-rail
on _my_ breast lay
with gold adorn’d.	[1110]
Me to _the_ ground drew
_a_ many-colour’d foe,
fast had _me_
_a_ grim _one_ in _his_ grasp;
yet was _it_ granted me,
that I _the_ miserable being
reach’d with _my_ point,
with _my_ war-falchion.
_A_ deadly blow destroy’d
_the_ mighty sea-beast	[1120]
through my hand.			IX.
Thus me frequently
_my_ hated foes
threaten’d violently:
I serv’d them
with _my_ dear sword,
as it was fitting.
Not they of that glut
had joy,
the foul destroyers,	[1130]
in eating me,		{38/39}
in sitting round _the_ feast
near to _the_ sea-ground:
but in _the_ morning,
with falchions wounded,
along _the_ waves’ leaving,
up _they_ lay,
put to sleep in shoals;
_so_ that not afterwards
about _the_ surgy ford	[1140]
to ocean sailers
have _they the_ way hinder’d.
Light came from _the_ east,
God’s bright beacon,
_the_ seas grew calm,
_so_ that _the_ sea-nesses I
might see,
windy walls.
Fate often saves
_an_ undoom’d man,	[1150]
when his valour avails.
Yet ’twas my lot
that with _my_ sword I slew
nickers nine.
I have not heard of by night,
under heaven’s vault,
_a_ harder fight,
nor in _the_ ocean-streams
_a_ man more miserable;
yet from _the_ grasp of dangers I	[1160]
with life escap’d
of _my_ journey weary.
Then _the_ sea bore me away,
_the_ flood along _the_ shore,		{39/40}
on _the_ Fins’ land,
_the_ boiling fords.
I never aught of thee
of such hostile snares
have heard say,
_such_ falchions’ terrors.	[1170]
Breca never yet,
at _the_ game of war.
nor either of you,
so dearly
deed perform’d
with hostile swords.
(Of this I boast not),
although thou of thy brothers
wast _the_ murderer,
_thy_ chief kinsmen;	[1180]
for which in hell thou shalt
damnation suffer,
although thy wit be good.
I say to thee in sooth,
son of Ecglaf,
that never Grendel so many
horrors had perpetrated,
_the_ fell wretch,
against thy prince,
harm in Heorot,	[1190]
if thy spirit were,
_thy_ mind so war-fierce,
as thou thyself supposest.
But he has found,
that he the hostility needs not,
_the_ fell sword-strength		{40/41}
of your people,
greatly care for,
of the victor-Scyldings;
_he_ takes _a_ forced pledge,	[1200]
on none has mercy,
of _the_ Danes’ people;
but he wars for pleasure,
slays and shends _you_,
nor strife expects
from _the_ Gar-Danes;
but _a_ Goth shall him
toil and valour,
now unexpectedly,
battle, offer.	[1210]
Shall go afterwards he who may,
elate to _the_ mead,
after _the_ morning light,
over _the_ children of men,
of _the_ second day,
t _he_ sun, heaven’s guardian,
from _the_ south shines.”
Then was rejoiced
_the_ distributor of treasure,
hoary-lock’d and war-fam’d,
trusted in succour	[1221]
_the_ bright Danes’ lord:
in Beowulf heard
_the_ people’s shepherd
steadfast resolve.
There was laughter of men,
_the_ din resounded,		{41/42}
words were winsome;
Wealhtheow went forth,
Hrothgar’s queen;	[1230]
mindful of _their_ races,
_the_ gold-adorn’d _one_ greeted
_the_ men in hall,
and then _the_ joyous woman
gave _the_ cup
first to _the_ East-Danes’
country’s guardian;
bade him [be] blithe
at the beer-drinking,
the dear to his people.	[1240]
He joyfully partook of
_the_ feast and hall-cup,
_the_ king renown’d for victory.
Went round then
_the_ Helmings’ dame
of old and young
every part,
treasure vessels gave,
until occasion offer’d,
that she to Beowulf,	[1250]
_the_ ring-adorned queen,
of mind exalted,
_the_ mead-cup bore:
greeted _the_ Goths’ lord,
thank’d God
sagacious in words,
that _the_ will had befall’n her,
that she in any
warrior should trust,
for comfort against crimes.	[1260]	{42/43}
He of _the_ cup partook,
_the_ fierce warrior,
from Wealhtheow,
and then said,
for battle eager:
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
“I resolv’d,
when on _the_ main I went,
_the_ sea-boat occupied,	[1270]
with my warrior band,
that I alone
your people’s
will would work,
or bow in death,
fast in hostile grasps.
I shall perform
_deeds of_ noble valour,
or my last day,
in this mead-hall,	[1280]
await.”
The woman those words
well lik’d,
the Goths’ proud speech;
adorn’d with gold went
_the_ joyful people’s queen,
by her lord to sit.
Then was again as ere,
within _the_ hall,
_the_ bold word spoken,	[1290]
_the_ people joyous,
_the_ victor nations’ cry,
until suddenly		{43/44}
Healfdene’s son
would seek
_his_ evening rest:
_he_ knew for the miserable
in the high hall
conflict was destin’d,
after _the_ sun’s light they
might [not] see,	[1301]
or murky
night over all
(the shadow-covering of creatures)
came advancing,
dusky under _the_ clouds.
The company all arose;
greeted then
_one_ man another,
Hrothgar Beowulf,	[1310]
and bade him hail,
_gave him_ command of _the_ wine-hall,
and the word said:
“Never have I to any man
before entrusted,
since I hand and shield
could raise,
_the_ Danes’ festive hall,
save now to thee.
Have now and hold	[1320]
_the_ best of houses;
be of glory mindful,		{44/45}
show _thy_ mighty valour,
keep watch against _the_ foes;
no lack of things desirable shall be for thee,
if thou that work of valour
with life escapest from."			X.
Hrothgar then departed
with his band of warriors,
_the_ Scyldings’ protector	[1330]
out of _the_ hall:
_the_ martial leader would
Wealhtheow seek,
_the_ queen, as bed-companion.
_The_ glory of kings had
against Grendel,
as men have heard tell,
_a_ hall-ward set:
_he_ held a separate office
about _the_ prince of _the_ Danes,	[1340]
_the_ ward announced _the_ eoten.
But _the_ Goths’ chief
well trusted in
_his_ haughty might,
_his_ Creator’s favour.
Then he doff’d from him
_his_ iron byrnie,		{45/46}
_the_ helmet from _his_ head,
gave his ornate sword,
choicest of irons,	[1350]
to _an_ attendant,
and bade _him_ hold
_the_ gear of war.
Spake the good _chief_ then
some words of pride,
Beowulf _the_ Goth,
ere on _his_ bed he stept:
“I myself _do not_ in martial vigour
feebler account,
of warlike works,	[1360]
than Grendel _does_ himself;
therefore I him with sword
will not lull to rest,
of life deprive,
although I easily may.
He knows not of that warfare,
that he strike against me,
hew _my_ shield,
fam’d though he be
for hostile works:	[1370]
but we two shall to-night
apply _ourselves_ to strife,
if he dare seek
war without weapon;
and afterwards _the_ wise God,
on whichsoever hand,
_the_ holy Lord,
shall glory doom,		{46/47}
as to him meet shall seem.”
Inclin’d him then _the_ martial beast,
_the_ bolster received _his_ cheek,	[1381]
_the_ warrior’s face;
and around him many _a_
keen seaman
bow’d to _his_ hall-couch.
Not one of them thought
that he should thence
_his_ lov’d home again
ever seek,
_his_ people or free city,	[1390]
where he was nurtur’d;
for they had heard tell that of them
before by much too many,
in that wine-hall,
_a_ bloody death had taken,
of _the_ Danes’ people.
But to them _the_ Lord gave
_the_ webs of battle-speed;
to _the_ Weders’ people,
comfort and succour,	[1400]
_so_ that they their foe,
by might of one,
all overcame,
by _his_ single powers.
Truly is _it_ shown,
that mighty God
rules _the_ race of men.
From afar came,
in _the_ murky night,		{47/48}
_the_ shadow-walker stalking;	[1410]
_the_ warriors slept,
who that pinnacled mansion
should defend,
all save one.
It to men was known,
that them might not
(since the Lord will’d it not)
_the_ sinful spoiler
under _the_ shade drag off.
But he watching	[1420]
in hate _the_ foe,
in angry mood awaited
_the_ battle-meeting.			XI.
Then came from _the_ moor,
under _the_ misty hills,
Grendel stalking;
_he_ God’s anger bare:
expected the wicked spoiler
of _the_ race of men
one to ensnare	[1430]
in the lofty hall.
_He_ strode under _the_ clouds,
until he _the_ wine-house,
_the_ golden hall of men,
most readily perceiv’d,
richly variegated.
Nor was that time _the_ first
that he Hrothgar’s		{48/49}
home had sought.
Never in _his_ life-days he,
ere nor since,	[1441]
_a_ bolder man,
_or_ hall-thanes found.
Came then to _the_ mansion
_the_ man journeying,
of joys depriv’d;
forthwith on _the_ door he rush’d,
fast with fire_-hard_ bands,
then he with _his_ hands it [touch’d];
undrew then _the_ baleful minded	[1450]
(as he was angry)
_the_ mansion’s mouth:
soon after that
on _the_ variegated floor
_the_ fiend trod;
went wroth of mood;
from his eyes stood,
to flame most like,
_a_ horrid light.
He in _the_ mansion saw	[1460]
warriors many
sleeping, _a_ kindred band,
all together,
_a_ company of fellow-warriors;
then his mood laugh’d:
_he_ expected that he would separate,
ere _the_ day came,		{49/50}
_the_ fell wretch,
of every one
life from body;	[1470]
then had arisen in him
hope of _a_ dainty glut:
yet ’twas not _his_ fate,
that he might more
of _the_ race of men
eat after that night.
Beheld _the_ strenuous
kinsman of Hygelac
how the wicked spoiler,
during _his_ sudden grasps,	[1480]
would proceed.
Nor did did that the miserable wight
mean to delay;
for he quickly seiz’d,
at _the_ first time,
_a_ sleeping warrior,
tore _him_ unawares,
bit _his_ bone-casings,
_the_ blood drank from _his_ veins,
in endless morsels swallow’d _him_;	[1490]
soon had _he_
of _the_ lifeless
all devour’d,
feet and hands:
nearer forth _he_ stept,
took then with _his_ hand
_the_ doughty-minded
warrior on _his_ couch.
_He_ reach’d towards
_the_ foe with _his_ hand;	[1500]	{50/51}
he instantly perceiv’d
_the_ guileful thoughts,
and on _his_ arm rested.
Soon as discover’d
_the_ criminal,
that he had not found
of mid-earth,
of _the_ world’s regions,
in _a_ stranger man,
_a_ stronger hand-gripe,	[1510]
he in mind became
fearful in soul;
not for that the sooner could he escape;
_his_ mind was bent on flight,
_he_ would into _his_ cavern flee,
_the_ pack of devils seek;
his condition there was not
such as he in _his_ life-days
before had found.
Remember’d then the good
kinsman of Hygelac
_his_ evening speech;
upright _he_ stood,
and at him firmly grasp’d;
_his_ fingers yielded,
_the_ eoten was outward;
_the_ earl stept further;
_the_ renown’d _champion_ thought,
whether he might _not_ so
more widely wheel _about_,	[1530]
and away thence
flee to _his_ fen-mound;		{51/52}
_he_ knew his fingers’ power,
in _his_ grasps of _the_ fierce _one_,
that he _the_ stronger was.
After the pernicious spoiler
to Heorot came,
_the_ princely hall thunder’d,
was for all _the_ Danes,
_the_ city-dwellers,	[1540]
every valiant one,
_the_ earls, _the_ ale spilt.
Angry were both,
fierce, _the_ powerful warders,
_the_ mansion resounded;
then great wonder was _it_,
that _the_ wine-hall
withstood _the_ warlike beasts,
_so_ that it fell not on _the_ ground,
_the_ fair earthly dwelling;	[1550]
but it was thus fast,
within and without,
with iron bands,
cunningly forged.
There from _its_ sill inclin’d
many _a_ mead-bench,
as I have heard tell,
with gold adorn’d,
where the fierce _ones_ fought:
therefore before ween’d not	[1560]
_the_ Scyldings’ sages,
that it ever in any wise
any man,
malicious and murder-stain’d,
could in pieces break,
_or_ craftily lay open,		{52/53}
_naught_ save _the_ flame’s embrace
should with _its_ heat devour _it_.
_A_ noise arose,
newly, abundantly;	[1570]
over _the_ North Danes stood
dire terror,
on every one
of those who from _the_ wall
heard _the_ whoop,
_the_ horrid lay sung
of God’s denier,
_the_ triumphless song,
_his_ pain bewailing,
of _the_ thrall of hell:	[1580]
held him [too] fast,
he who of men was
strongest of might,
in that day
of this life.			XII.
Would not _the_ refuge of earls
for any thing
the deadly guest,
leave living,
nor his life-days	[1590]
to any people
accounted useful.
Then forthwith drew
_a_ warrior of Beowulf’s
_an_ ancient relic;
_he_ would _his_ lord’s		{53/54}
life defend,
_the_ great prince’s,
if they might so _do_.
They knew it not,	[1600]
when they endur’d _the_ strife,
_the_ bold eager
sons of battle,
and on every side
thought to hew,
_his_ soul to seek,
_that_ the wicked scather
on earth not any
choicest of irons
no battle falchion,	[1610]
would touch:
but he martial weapons
had forsworn,
every hedge whatever.
His life-divorce was,
on that day
of this life
to be miserable,
and the departing ghost
into _the_ power of fiends	[1620]
far to travel,
Then that found,
he who before many,
in mirth of mood,
against _the_ race of men,
crimes had perpetrated,
(he was _the_ foe of God,)
that him his body		{54/55}
would not avail;
for him the proud	[1630]
kinsman of Hygelac
had in hand;
was each to other
hateful living;
body pain endur’d
_the_ fell wretch;
on his shoulder was
_a_ deadly wound manifest,
_the_ sinews sprang asunder,
_the_ bone-casings burst;	[1640]
to Beowulf was
warlike fierceness given;
Grendel must thence
death-sick flee
under _his_ fen-shelters
seek _a_ joyless dwelling;
_he_ the better knew
that was his life’s
end pass’d,
his day’s number.	[1650]
For all _the_ Danes was,
after that mortal conflict
_their_ will accomplish’d.
Had then purified
he who had before come from afar,
wise and strong of soul,
Hrothgar’s hall,
sav’d it from malice.
In _his_ night-work _he_ rejoiced
his valour glories;	[1660]	{55/56}
had to _the_ East-Danes
_the_ Goths’ chieftain
_his_ boast fulfilled,
as also in _the_ country
_he_ had heal’d
_the_ preying sorrow,
that they before had sufier’d,
and for hard necessity
had to endure,
affliction not a little,	[1670]
It was _a_ token manifest
when _the_ beast of war
laid down _the_ hand.
_the_ arm and shoulder:
there was altogether
Grendel’s grasp
under _the_ vaulted roof.			XIII.
Then was in _the_ morning,
as I have heard tell,
around the gift-hall	[1680]
many _a_ warrior:
_the_ nation’s chieftains came,
from far and near
o’er distant ways,
_the_ wonder to behold,		{56/57}
_the_ traces of the foe:
his life-divorce did not
seem painful
to any warrior,
who _the_ inglorious’s	[1690]
track beheld;
how he in spirit weary
away thence,
in hostilities overcome,
to _the_ nickers’ mere,
death-doom’d and put to flight,
death-traces bare.
There was with blood
_the_ surge boiling,
_the_ dire swing of waves	[1700]
all mingled;
hot with clotted blood
_it_ well’d, with fatal gore,
_the_ death-doom’d had dyed _it_,
after _he_ joyless,
in _his_ fen-asylum,
laid down _his_ life,
_his_ heathen soul:
there him hell receiv’d.
Thence again departed	[1710]
_the_ old comrades,
as also many _a_ young _one_,
from _the_ joyous way,
proud from _the_ mere,
to ride on horses,
_the_ warriors on steeds.
There was Beowulf’s
glory celebrated;
many oft said,		{57/58}
that _nor_ south nor north,	[1720]
between _the_ seas
over _the_ spacious earth
not any other,
under heaven’s course,
better were
of shield-bearers,
worthier of power.
Nor yet did they _their_ belov’d lord
_in_ aught reprehend,
_the_ joyful Hrothgar,	[1730]
for that was _a_ good king.
At times _the_ fam’d in war
let run,
in contest go,
_their_ fallow steeds,
where to them _the_ earth- ways
fair appear’d,
_the_ fam’d for virtues.
At times _a_ king’s thane,
a vaunt-laden man,	[1740]
mindful of songs,
who full many
old legends,
_a_ great number, remember’d,
found another theme
with truth combin’d.
Then _the_ man began
Beowulf’s enterprize
discreetly to celebrate,
and diligently to relate,	[1750]
_the_ tale with skill
in words impart.		{58/59}
Well _he_ each thing told
that he of Sigemund
had heard related,
of valorous deeds,
much unknown,
_the_ Wælsing’s battles,
wide journeyings,
of which _the_ children of men
well knew not,
_his_ warfare and _his_ crimes,
save Fitela _who was_ with him.
Then he something such-like
would tell,
_of the_ uncle _and_ his nephew,
bow they ever were,
at every strife,
needful associates.
_They_ had full many	[1770]
of _the_ Jutes’ race
with _their_ swords laid low.
To Sigemund sprang,
after _his_ death-day,
no little glory,
after _the_ bold in battle
_the_ worm bad slain,
_the_ guardian of _the_ hoard.
He under _a_ hoar stone,
_the_ prince’s child, 	[1780]
alone ventur’d on
the daring deed:
Fitela was not with _him_;		{59/60}
yet ’twas his fortune,
that his sword pierced through
_the_ wondrous worm,
_so_ that in _the_ wall stood _fast_
_the_ noble iron:
_the_ dragon by death perish’d.
_The_ miserable being had	[1790]
by daring gain’d,
that he _the_ ring-hoard
might enjoy
at _his_ own pleasure.
_The_ sea-boat loaded,
bore into _the_ ship’s bosom
_the_ bright ornaments
Wælse’s offspring.
Heat _the_ worm consum’d.
He of wanderers was	[1800]
by far _the_ greatest
throughout _the_ human race,
_the_ warriors’ refuge,
by valiant deeds:
therefore at first _he_ throve:
_but_ after Heremod’s
war had ceas’d,
_his_ toil and energy:
he among _the_ Jutes was,
into _the_ foes’ power	[1810]
forthwith betray’d,
quickly exil’d;
him sorrow’s boilings
had too long afflicted;		{60/61}
to his people he became,
to all _his_ nobles,
a life-long care.
In such guise oft bewail’d,
in former times,
_the_ bold-heart’s lot	[1820]
many _a_ sagacious man,
who had to him of bales
for reparation trusted;
_and_ that _the_ prince’s child
should thrive,
succeed to _his_ father’s honours,
defend _his_ people,
_his_ treasure and refuge-city,
_the_ realm of heroes,
_the_ country of _the_ Scyldings.	[1830]
There to all was he,
Hygelac’s kinsman,
to _the_ race of men,
to _his_ friends, more grateful;
him crime had enter’d.
Sometimes contending,
_the_ fallow street
_they_ with _their_ horses measur’d.
When _the_ morning light was
sent forth and hasten’d,	[1840]
went many _a_ warrior
of strong purpose
to the high hall,		{61/62}
to see _the_ curious wonder.
So also _the_ king himself
from _his_ nuptial bower,
_the_ guardian of ring-treasures,
stept glorious,
with _a_ large company,
for virtues fam’d,	[1850]
and his queen with him,
_the_ meadow-path measur’d
with _a_ company of maidens.			XIV.
Hrothgar spake:
(he to _the_ hall went,
stood in _the_ fore-court,
saw _the_ steep roof
with gold variegated,
and Grendel’s hand:)
“For this sight	[1860]
to _the_ Almighty thanks
forthwith take place!
Much of malice I have endur’d,
snares from Grendel:
ever can God work
wonder after wonder,
glory’s Guardian.
It was not long since,
that I of any
woes ween’d not,	[1870]
for all time,
compensation to await me,
when with blood stain’d		{62/63}
_the_ best of houses
all gory stood;
misery _was_ wide-spread
o’er each of _my_ counsellors,
who weened not
that they evermore
_the_ people’s land-work	[1880]
could from foes defend,
devils and phantoms
Now _this_ warrior has,
through _the_ Lord’s might,
_a_ deed perform’d,
which we all
ere could not
with cunning machinate.
Yes! that may say,
lo! whatever matron,	[1890]
who this son brought forth,
after human kind,
if she yet lives,
that to her _the_ great Creator
was gracious
in _her_ child-bearing.
Now I, Beowulf,
thee, best of warriors,
as _a_ son will
love in _my_ heart:	[1900]
hold henceforth well
_our_ new kinship:
_there_ shall not be to thee any lack
of worldly things desirable,
that I have power over.		{63/64}
Full oft I for less
have _a_ reward decreed,
treasure-honour
to _a_ feebler warrior,
worse in conflict.	[1910]
Thou for thyself hast
_so_ by deeds achiev’d,
that thy glory lives
through every age.
_May the_ Omnipotent thee
with good reward,
as he yet as done.”
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
“We that arduous work	[1920]
with great good will,
that fight have achiev’d,
boldly ventur’d on
_the_ monster’s warfare:
rather would I have given,
that thou himself
mightest have seen,
_the_ foe in _his_ trappings,
slaughter-weary.
I him quickly,	[1930]
with hard bonds,
on _his_ death-bed,
thought to bind,
_so_ that through my hand-gripe
he should
lie for life struggling,		{64/65}
without his carcase’s escape.
I could not him
(as _the_ Creator will’d it not)
from _his_ course cut off;	[1940]
I did not him therefore easily assail,
_the_ deadly enemy;
was too greatly powerful
_the_ foe on foot;
ye he his hand has left,
as _a_ life-support,
to guard _his_ track,
_his_ arm and shoulder:
yet not any there
_the_ wretched man	[1950]
comfort bought,
nor will the longer live
_the_ hateful criminal,
with sins oppress’d;
for pain has him
in hostile gripe
straitly clasp’d,
harm, in _its_ bonds:
there shall await
_the_ wretch stain’d with crime	[1960]
_the_ great doom,
how to him _the_ bright Creator
will prescribe.”
Then was _the_ warrior more silent,
Ecglaf’s son,
in vaunting speech
of works of war,		{65/66}
after _the_ nobles,
through _the_ hero’s might,
over _the_ high roof	[1970]
had beheld _the_ hand,
_the_ foe’s fingers:
each was before,
instead of nails, [each]
to steel most like,
_the_ heathen’s hand-spurs,
_the_ warrior’s,
_the_ terrific _one’s_ sword.
Every one said that it,
(of _the_ bold ones) none	[1980]
would touch;
_no_ iron of prime goodness,
that the miserable being’s
bloody battle-hand
would taste of.			XV.
Then was quickly order’d
Heort inward
_to be_ with hands adorn’d:
many were of those,
men and women.	[1990]	{66/67}
who the wine-house,
_the_ guest-hall prepar’d;
gold-varied shone
_the_ webs along _the_ walls,
wondrous sights many
to every human being,
of those who gaze on such.
That bright dwelling was
much shatter’d,
all within	[2000]
with bands of iron fast;
_the_ hinges _were_ rent asunder;
_the_ roof alone was sav’d,
wholly sound,
when the miserable being,
stain’d with criminal deeds,
turn’d to flight,
hopeless of life.
That is not easy
to flee from,	[2010]
accomplish _it_ who will;
but _he_ shall seek
for soul-bearers,
by need compel’d,
for _the_ children of men,
for earth’s inhabitants
_the_ place prepar’d,
where his body,
fast in _its_ bed of death.
after the feast shall sleep.	[2020]	{67/68}
Then was _the_ time and moment,
that to _the_ hall should go
Healfdene’s son;
_the_ king himself would
of _the_ feast partake.
Never have I heard of the tribe
in _a_ greater body
about their treasure-giver
better bearing themselves.
Bow’d then to _the_ bench	[2030]
_the_ prosperous _warriors_,
in _the_ plenty _they_ rejoiced,
joyful partook of
many _a_ mead cup
_the_ kinsmen of those
stout-daring _warriors_,
in the high hall,
Hrothgar and Hrothulf.
Heorot within was
fill’d with friends;	[2040]
no treacheries
_the_ noble Scyldings
the while perpetrated.
Gave then to Beowulf,
_the_ son of Healfdene,
_a_ golden banner,
in reward of victory,
_an_ ensign with hilt adorn’d,
_a_ helm and byrnie;
_a_ sword, _a_ great treasure,	[2050]
many saw
before _the_ hero borne.		{68/69}
Beowulf partook of
_the_ cup in _the_ court;
not of that precious gift he,
before _the_ warriors,
needed feel shame.
Never have I heard more friendly
four precious things,
with gold adorn’d,	[2060]
many men,
on _the_ ale-bench,
to others give.
Around the helmet’s roof,
_the_ head-guard,
with wires bound round,
held slaughter without,
_so_ that him _the_ fallow sword
might not dangerously,
scour-harden’d, injure,	[2070]
when _the_ bold shielded warrior
against _his_ foes
should go.
Bade then _the_ shelter of warriors
eight steeds,
with cheek adorn’d,
into _the_ court be led,
in under _the_ enclosures;		{69/70}
on one of them stood
_a_ saddle cunningly variegated,	[2080]
with treasure ornamented:
that was _the_ war-seat
of _the_ high king,
when _the_ game of swords
_the_ son of Healfdene
would perform:
(never in warfare fiag’d
_the_ wide-fam’d’s martial ardour,
when _the_ slaughter’d fell),
and then to Beowulf	[2090]
of both one and other
_the_ Ingwinas’ protector
possession gave,
of horses and weapons:
bade him _them_ well enjoy.
Thus manfully
_the_ great prince,
_the_ treasure-ward of heroes,
warlike onslaughts requited,
with steeds and treasures.	[2100]
So them never man will blame.
who will say
_the_ sooth rightly.			XVI.
Then besides to each,
_the_ lord of warriors,
of those who with Beowulf
_the_ sea-way came,
on the mead-bench,		{70/71}
_a_ present gave
_an_ hereditary relic;	[2110]
and bade the one
with gold be paid for,
whom Grendel ere
wickedly had slain,
as he would more of them,
had not him _the_ wise God,
fate, prevented,
and the man’s courage.
_The_ Creator rul’d all
_the_ race of men,	[2120]
as he now yet does;
therefore is understanding
everywhere best,
forethought of spirit:
much shall abide
of lov’d and loath’d,
who long here
in these days of strife
in _the_ world participates.
There were song and sound
at once together	[2131]
before Healfdene’s
martial leaders,
_the_ glee-wood was touch’d,
the lay oft recited,
when _the_ joy of hall
Hrothgar’s gleeman,
after _the_ mead-bench,
should recount
[of] Fin’s offspring,	[2140]
when them peril o’erwhelm’d;		{71/72}
_when_ Healfdene’s hero,
_the_ Scyldings’ Hnæf,
in Friesland
was doom’d to fall.
Not Hildeburh at least
had need to praise
_the_ faith of _the_ Jutes:
sinless she was
of _her_ belov’d _ones_ depriv’d	[2150]
at the linden play,
_her_ children and brothers;
they in succession fell,
by _the_ dart wounded;
that was _a_ mournful woman.
Not without cause
Hoce’s daughter,
_the_ Lord’s decree bemourn’d,
after morning came,
when she under heaven	[2160]
might see
_the_ slaughter of _her_ kinsmen,
where she ere had most possess’d
of _the_ world’s joy.
War had destroy’d all
Fin’s thanes,
save _a_ few only,
_so_ that he might not
on the battle-place
against Hengest	[2170]
aught gain in fight,
nor the sad remnant		{72/73}
by war protect
from _the_ king’s thane;
but they offer’d him conditions,
that they to him another dwelling
would wholly yield,
_a_ hall and throne,
that they half power
with _the_ sons of _the_ Jutes	[2180]
might possess,
and at _the_ money-gifts,
Folcwalda’s son.
every day,
_the_ Danes should honour,
Hengest’s band
with rings should serve,
even as much
with precious treasures
of rich gold,	[2190]
as he _the_ Frisian race
in _the_ beer-hall
would decorate.
Then they confirm’d
on _the_ two sides
_a_ fast peaceful compact;
Fin to Hengest,
earnestly without dispute,
with oaths declar’d,
that he the sad remnant,	[2200]
by _his_ ‘witan’s’ doom
piously would maintain,
_so_ that there _not_ any man,
by words or works,		{73/74}
should break _the_ compact,
nor through guileful craft
should _they_ ever lament,
though they their ring-giver’s
slayer follow’d,
_now_ lordless,	[2210]
as _it_ was thus needful to them:
but if of _the_ Frisians any,
by audacious speech,
this deadly feud
should call to mind,
then it _the_ edge of sword
should appease.
_The_ oath was taken,
and moreover gold
rais’d from _the_ hoard.	[2220]
Of _the_ martial Scyldings
_the_ best of warriors
on _the_ pile was ready:
at the heap was
easy to be seen
_the_ blood-stain’d sark,
_the_ swine all golden,
_the_ boar iron-hard,
many _a_ noble
with wounds injur’d,	[2230]
(some had in the slaughter fall’n).
Bade then Hildeburh,
at Hnæf’s pile,
her own sons
be to _the_ fire committed,		{74/75}
_their_ carcases be burnt,
and on _the_ pile be done
_the_ luckless _ones_ to ashes.
_The_ lady mourn’d,
bewail’d in songs;	[2240]
_the_ warrior ascended,
eddied to _the_ clouds;
_the_ greatest of death-fires
roar’d before _the_ mound,
_their_ heads were consum’d,
_their_ wound-gates burst,
then _the_ blood sprang out
from _the_ corpse’s hostile bite:
flame swallow’d all
(greediest of guests)	[2250]
those whom there war had destroy’d:
of both nations was
their prosperity departed.			XVII.
_The_ warriors then departed
_the_ dwellings to visit,
of _their_ friends bereft,
Friesland to see,		{75/76}
_the_ homes and chief city.
Hengest still
_the_ death-hued winter	[2260]
dwelt with Fin
without dissension;
_his_ home remember’ d,
though he might
on _the_ sea drive
_the_ ringed prow.
_The_ deep boil’d with storm,
war’d ’gainst _the_ wind,
winter lock’d up _the_ wave
with icy bond,	[2270]
until _there_ came _a_ second
year into _the_ courts;
so now yet do
those who constantly
watch _a_ happy moment,
gloriously bright weather.
Then was winter departed,
earth’s bosom fair,
_the_ stranger hasten’d,
_the_ guest from _the_ dwellings:	[2280]
he on wily vengeance
was more intent
than on _a_ sea-voyage,
if he _a_ hostile meeting
could bring to pass;
because he _the_ sons of _the_ Jutes		{76/77}
inwardly remember’d:
so he refus’d not
worldly converse,
when he Hunlafing,	[2290]
_the_ flame of war,
_the_ best of falchions,
in his bosom placed;
for with _the_ Jutes there were
_men_ for _the_ sword renown’d,
also of spirit bold.
Fin afterwards o’erwhelm’d
hard misery from _the_ sword,
at his own home.
When _him_ fierce of gripe	[2300]
Guthlaf and Oslaf,
after _their_ sea voyage,
had grievously upbraided,
reproach’d for part of _their_ woes,
_he_ might not _his_ wavering courage.
in _his_ breast retain.
Then was _his_ hall beset
with hostile men,		{77/78}
Fin also slain,
_the_ king amid _his_ train,	[2310]
and the queen taken.
_The_ Scyldings’ warriors
to _their_ ships convey’d
all _the_ house chattels
of _the_ land’s king,
such as they at Finnesham
might find,
of jewels and curious gems.
They on the sea-way
_the_ princely woman	[2320]
to _the_ Danes convey’d,
to _their_ people led.
_The_ lay was sung,
_the_ gleeman’s song,
pastime rose again,
_the_ bench-noise was loud,
_the_ cupbearers gave
wine from curious vessels.
Then came Wealtheow forth,
walking under _a_ golden diadem,
_to_ where the two good	[2331]
cousins sat;
as yet was their peace together,
each to other true;		{78/79}
there also Hunferth _the_ orator
sat at _the_ feet of _the_ Scyldings’ lord;
every _one_ of them was confident in his mind,
that he had great courage,
although he to his kinsman had not been
true in _the_ plays of swords.	[2340]
Spake then _the_ Scyldings’ dame:
“Accept this cup,
my beloved lord,
dispenser of treasure;
be thou happy,
gold-friend of men:
and to _the_ Goths speak
with kind words,
as one should do:
be cheerful towards _the_ Goths,	[2350]
mindful of gifts,
near and far:
thou hast now [promis’d,]
I have been told,
that thou for _a_ son wouldst
_the_ warrior have.
Heorot is purified,
the bright hall of rings:
enjoy while thou mayest
_the_ mead of _the_ many,	[2360]
and to thy sons leave		{79/80}
folk and realm,
when thou forth must _go_
to see _the_ Godhead.
I know my
festive Hrothulf,
that he the youthful will
piously maintain;
if thou earlier than he,
O friend of Scyldings,	[2370]
leavest _the_ world:
I ween that he with good
will repay
our offspring;
if he that all remembers
what we two for _his_ pleasure
and honours,
erst when _a_ child,
of benefits perform’d.”
Turn’d then by _the_ bench,	[2380]
where her sons were,
Hrethric and Hrothmund,
and _the_ children of warriors,
_the_ youth together,
where sat the good
Beowulf _the_ Goth,
by the two brethren.			XVIII.
To him _the_ cup was borne,
and friendly invitation
in words offer’d,	[2390]
and twisted gold
kindly shown,		{80/81}
sleeves two,
_a_ mantle and rings,
of collars _the_ largest
of those that I on earth
have heard tell of:
not any under heaven I
more excellent have heard of
treasure-board of men,	[2400]
since Hama bore off
to _the_ noble bright city
_the_ Brosings’ necklace,
_the_ jewel and _its_ casket:
_he_ into _the_ guileful enmity fell
of Eormenric;
_and_ choose th’ eternal council.
That ring had
Hygelac _the_ Goth,
Swerting’s nephew,	[2410]
_the_ last time,
when he under _his_ banner
_his_ treasure defended,
guarded _the_ spoil of _the_ slain:
him fate took off,
after be for pride
sought _his own_ woe,
_a_ war with _the_ Frisians:
he the ornament convey’d,
_the_ precious stones,	[2420]	{81/82}
over _the_ cup of waves,
_the_ powerful king;
he fell beneath _his_ shield:
departed then into _the_ grasp of _the_ Franks
_the_ king’s life,
_his_ breast-weeds,
and the collar also:
worse warriors
plunder’d the fall’n,
after _the_ lot of war;	[2430]
_the_ Goths’ people
held _the_ mansion of _the_ dead.
_The_ hall receiv’d _the_ sound:
Wealhtheow spake,
before the company she said:
“Use this collar,
dear Beowulf,
O youth, with prosperity,
and this mantle enjoy,
_these_ lordly treasures,	[2440]
and thrive well:
animate thyself with vigour,
and to these boys be
in counsels gentle;
I will therefore be mindful to reward thee.
Thou hast _that_ achiev’d,
that thee far and near,
throughout all time,
men will esteem,
even as widely	[2450]
as _the_ sea encircles		{82/83}
_the_ windy land-walls.
Be while thou livest
_a_ prosperous noble:
I will well grant thee
precious treasures:
be thou to my sons
gentle in deeds,
holding _them_ in joy.
Here is every man	[2460]
to other true,
mild of mood,
to _his_ liege lord faithful;
_the_ thanes are united,
_the_ people all ready,
_the_ drunken vassals
do as I bid.”
_She_ went then to _her_ seat:
there was of feasts _the_ choicest,
_the_ men drank wine,	[2470]
fate _they_ knew not,
grim calamity,
how it had befallen
many _a_ man.
After evening came,
and Hrothgar had departed
to his court,
_the_ powerful _one_ to rest,
guarded _the_ mansion
countless warriors,	[2480]
as they oft ere had done;		{83/84}
_they_ bared _the_ bench-floor:
it was overspread
with beds and bolsters.
Of _the_ beer-skinkers one,
ready and fated,
bow’d to _his_ domestic couch:
they set at _their_ heads
_their_ disks of war,
their shield-wood bright;	[2490]
there on _the_ bench was,
over _the_ noble,
easy to be seen
_his_ high martial helm,
_his_ ringed byrnie,
_and_ war-wood stout.
_It_ was their custom,
that they oft were
for war prepar’d,
both at home and in _the_ host,	[2500]
or both of them;
just at such times
as to their liege lord
need befel
was the people ready.			XIX.
They sank then to sleep:
one sorely paid for
_his_ evening rest,		{84/85}
as to them full oft had happen’d,
since the gold-hall	[2510]
Grendel occupied,
unrighteousness perpetrated,
until an end came,
death after sins.
That was seen,
wide-known to men,
that _an_ avenger yet
liv’d after the foe,
for _a_ long space,
after _the_ battle-care,	[2520]
Grendle’s mother;
_the_ woman, wretched crone,
was of _her_ misery mindful,
she who _the_ watery horrors
must inhabit,
_the_ cold streams,
after Cain became
_the_ murderer
of his _only_ brother,
_his_ father’s son.	[2530]
He then blood-stain’d departed
by murder mark’d,
fleeing _the_ joy of man,
dwelt in _the_ waste;
thence arose many
wretched sprites,
of those was Grendel one,
_the_ hateful fell wolf;
who had at Heorot found
_a_ watching man	[2540]	{85/86}
_the_ conflict awaiting,
where for him the miserable being
food-greedy was;
yet he remember’d
the strength of his might,
_the_ abundant gift,
that God had given him,
and in him as sole Ruler
piously trusted,
_his_ comfort and support;	[2550]
therefore he overcame the foe,
subdued _the_ sprite of hell;
then he humble departed,
of joy depriv’d,
_the_ mansion of death to see,
_the_ foe of mankind;
but his mother yet,
greedy and gallows-minded,
would go
_a_ sorrowful journey,	[2560]
direfully to avenge _her_ son.
_She_ came then to Heorot,
where _the_ Ring-Danes
throughout the hall were sleeping.
Then forthwith there was
_a_ relapse to _the_ warriors.
When in rush’d
Grendle’s mother,		{86/87}
was the terror less,
by just as much	[2570]
as is _the_ power of maidens,
_the_ hostile dread from women,
to _that_ from _an_ arm’d man,
when strongly bound,
with hammer beaten,
_the_ sword stain’d with gore,
_the_ swine above _the_ helm,
doughty of edges,
present shears,
Then was in _the_ hall	[2580]
_the_ hard edge drawn,
_the_ sword over the seats,
many _a_ broad disk
rais’d fast in hand,
helm _the warrior_ remember’d not,
_nor_ ample byrnie,
when terror was on him shed.
She was in haste,
would out from thence
save _her_ life,	[2590]
as she was discover’d.
Of _the_ nobles quickly she
had one
fast seiz’d,
as to _the_ fen she went;
he was to Hrothgar
of heroes dearest,
in _a_ comrades’ character,
between _the_ seas,		{87/88}
_a_ powerful shield-warrior,	[2600]
whom she on _his_ couch destroy’d,
_a_ prosperous hero.
Beowulf was not there,
for another dwelling had been
before assign’d,
after _the_ costly gift,
to _the_ renown’d Goth.
There was _a_ cry in Heorot;
she amid clotted gore took
the _well_ known hand;	[2610]
grief had renew’d
become in the dwellings.
That was no good exchange,
that they on both sides
must buy
with _the_ lives of friends.
Then was _the_ wise king,
_the_ hoary man of war,
in angry mood,
when he _his_ senior thane	[2620]
lifeless,
the dearest,
knew _to be_ dead.
Quickly to _his_ bower was
Beowulf fetch’d,
_the_ victorious warrior.
Together ere day
went with some of _his_ earls
_the_ noble champion,
himself with _his_ comrades,	[2630]
to where the wise _prince_ awaited,
whether him _the_ All-powerful		{88/89}
ever would,
after _the_ sad intelligence,
_his_ fortune prosper,
Went then along _the_ floor
_the_ warlike man
with his suite,
(_the_ hall-wood resounded)
_till_ that he the wise _prince_	[2640]
by _his_ words sooth’d,
_the_ Ingwinas’ lord;
ask’d if he had had,
after _the_ urgent summons,
_an_ easy night.			XX.
Hrothgar spake,
_the_ Scylding’s protector:
“Ask thou not after happiness;
sorrow is renew’d
to _the_ Danes’ people;	[2650]
Æschere is dead,
Yrmenlaf’s
elder brother,
my confident,
and my counsellor,
_my_ near attendant,
when we in war
our heads defended,
when hosts against _each other_ rush’d		{89/90}
_and_ boar-crests crash’d:	[2660]
such should _a_ man be,
preeminently good * *
such as Æschere was.
To him in Heorot there has been
for murderer
_a_ deadly wandering guest.
I know not whether
_the_ fell giorier in carrion
_her_ steps back has traced,
with slaughter comforted.	[2670]
She has avenged the quarrel,
for that thou yesternight
didst Grendel slay,
through _thy_ vehement nature,
with hard grasps;
for that he too long
my people
diminish’d and destroy’d:
he in battle succumb’d,
_his_ life forfeiting,	[2680]
and now is come another
mighty fell destroyer,
_who_ would her son avenge,
_she_ far off has
warfare establish’d,
as _it_ may seem,
for many _a_ thane,
who after _his_ treasure-giver
in spirit weeps,
in hard heart-affliction.	[2690]
Now the hand lies _low_,
which you for every		{90/91}
desire avail’d.
I it _the_ land’s inhabitants,
my people,
my hall-counsellors,
have heard say,
that they have seen
two such
huge march-stalkers	[2700]
inhabiting _the_ moors,
stranger guests,
of which one was,
from what they most certainly
could know,
a woman’s likeness,
_the_ other wretched wight,
in _a_ man’s figure,
trod _a_ wanderer’s footsteps.
save that he greater was than	[2710]
any other man,
whom in days of yore
Grendel nam’d
earth’s inhabitants:
they _a_ father know not,
whether any to them was
before born
of _the_ dark ghosts.
They _that_ secret land
inhabit, _the_ wolf’s retreats,
windy nesses,
_the_ dangerous fen-path,
where _the_ mountain-stream,
under _the_ nesses’ mists,
downward flows,		{91/92}
_the_ flood under _the_ earth.
_It_ is not far thence,
_a_ mile’s distance,
that _the_ mere stands,
over which hang	[2730]
barky groves;
_a_ wood fast by _its_ roots
_the_ water overshadows:
there every night may
_a_ dire miracle be seen,
fire in _the_ flood.
No one so wise lives
of _the_ children of men,
who the bottom knows.
Although _the_ heath-stalker,	[2740]
by _the_ hounds wearied,
_the_ hart firm of horns,
seek _that_ holt-wood,
driven from afar,
ere will he life resign,
_his_ breath upon _the_ bank,
ere he will in _it_
[hide] _his_ head:
that is no holy place;
thence _the_ wave-blending	[2750]
rises up
dark to _the_ clouds,
when _the_ wind stirs
hateful tempests,
until _the_ air grows gloomy,
_the_ heavens shed tears.
Now is counsel long
again of thee alone;		{92/93}
_the_ spot _thou_ yet knowest not,
the perilous place,	[2760]
where thou mayest find
_this_ much sinful man.
Seek it if thou durst;
I will thee for the strife
with money recompense,
with old treasures,
as I before did,
with twisted gold,
if away thou comest.”			XXI.
Beowulf spake,	[2770]
Ecgtheow’s son:
“Sorrow not, sage man,
better ’tis for every one
that he his friend avenge,
than that he greatly mourn.
Each of us must
_an_ end await
of _this_ world’s life:
let him who can, work
high deeds ere death;	[2780]
to _the_ warrior that will _be_,
_when_ lifeless,
afterwards best.
Arise, guardian of _the_ realm,
let us quickly go
of Grendel’s parent
_the_ course to see:
I promise it thee,		{93/94}
not into _the_ sea shall she escape,
nor into earth’s bosom,	[2790]
nor into _the_ mountain-wood,
nor in ocean’s ground,
go whither she will.
This day _do_ thou
have patience
for every woe,
as I expect from thee.”
Leapt up then the aged _man_,
thank’d God,
_the_ mighty Lord,	[2800]
for what the man had said.
Then was for Hrothgar
_a_ horse bitted,
_a_ steed with curled mane.
_The_ wise prince
stately went;
_a_ troop of men proceeded,
shield-bearing.
Traces were
after _the_ forest-spoiler	[2810]
widely seen,
_her_ course o’er _the_ grounds
before them,
over _the_ murky moor:
of _their_ fellow thanes _she_ bore
the best
soulless,
of those who with Hrothgar
_their_ home defended.		{94/95}
Went over then	[2820]
_these_ sons of nobles
deep rocky gorges,
_a_ narrow road,
strait lonely paths,
_an_ unknown way,
precipitous headlands,
nicker-houses many.
He with _a_ few
went before,
wise men,	[2830]
_the_ plain to view,
until he suddenly
mountain-trees,
o’er the hoar rock
found leaning,
a joyless wood;
water stood beneath
gory and troubled;
To all _the_ Danes _it_ was,
_the_ Scyldings’ friends,	[2840]
grievous in mind
to suffer,
to many _a_ thane,
portentous to every warrior,
when of Æschere,
on the sea-shore,
_the_ head _they_ found.
_The_ flood boil’d with blood,
_the_ people look’d on
_the_ hot gore;	[2850]
_the_ horn at times sang
also _a_ death song.		{95/96}
_The_ band all sat;
_they_ saw along _the_ water
of _the_ worm-kind many,
strange sea dragons,
tempting _the_ deep;
also in _the_ headland-clefts
nickers lying,
which at morning time	[2860]
oft keep
_their_ sorrowful course
on _the_ sail-road,
worms and wild beasts:
they sped away,
bitter and angry,
_the_ instant they heard
_the_ war-horn sing:
one _the_ Goths’ lord,
from _his_ arrow-bow,
from life separated,
_from his_ wave-strife,
_so_ that in his vitals stood
_the_ hard war-shaft:
he in _the_ sea was
in swimming the slower,
when him death took off.
Quickly on _the_ waves was _he_
with boar-spears
sharply hook’d,	[2880]
hardly press’d,
humbled of _his_ mischiefs,
and on _the_ headland drawn,
_the_ wondrous wave-bearer:		{96/97}
_the_ men gaz’d on
_the_ grisly guest.
Clad himself Beowulf
in warlike weeds:
for life _he_ car’d not;
_his_ martial byrnie must,	[2890]
with hands twisted,
ample and curiously variegated,
tempt _the_ deep,
which _his_ body
could _well_ secure,
_so_ that hostile gripe his
breast might not,
_the_ wrothful’s wily grasp,
_his_ life injure:
but the bright helm	[2900]
guarded _that_ head,
(which _the_ sea-grounds
should disturb,
seek _the_ mingle of _the_ deep,)
with treasure ornamented,
with noble chains encircled,
as it in days of yore
_the_ armourer wrought,
wondrously fram’d,
beset with forms of swine,	[2910]
so that it afterwards no
brand nor battle-falchions
might bite.
Nor then was that _the_ least
of powerful aids,
which at need him lent		{97/98}
Hrothgar’s orator.
Was of that hafted falchion
Hrunting _the_ name ;
that had before been one	[2920]
of _the_ old treasures;
_its_ edge was iron
tainted with poisonous twigs,
harden’d with warrior-blood;
never in battle had it deceiv’d
any man,
of those who brandish’d it with hands,
who ways of terror
durst go,
_the_ trysting place of perils.		[2930]
That time was not _the_ first,
that it _a_ work of valour
should achieve:
at all events remember’d not
Ecglaf’s son,
crafty in trouble,
what he ere had said,
with wine drunken,
when he the weapon lent
to _a_ better sworded warrior.	[2940]
Himself durst not
amid _the_ strife of waves
venture _his_ life,
_a_ noble deed perform;
there he _his_ credit lost
for valorous deeds;		{98/99}
not so was _it_ with _the_ other,
when himself for battle he
had prepared.			XXII.
Beowulf spake,	[2950]
Ecgtheow’s son:
“Let now bear in mind the great
son of Healfdene,
_the_ sagacious prince,
now I am ready for _my_ journey,
gold-friend of men,
what we have before spoken:
If I for thy
need should
lose my life,	[2960]
that thou wouldst ever be to me,
_when_ hence departed,
in _a_ father’s stead.
Be thou _a_ guardian
to my fellow thanes,
_my_ near comrades,
if war take me _off_;
also _do_ thou the treasures,
which thou hast given me,
dear Hrothgar,	[2970]
send to Hygelac:
then by that gold may know
_the_ Goth’s lord,
the _son_ of Hrethel see,
when he on that treasure gazes,		{99/100}
that I for _his_ bounties
found _a_ good
distributor of rings:
_I_ enjoyed _them_ when _I_ might.
And do thou let Hunferth	[2980]
_the_ ancient relic,
_the_ curious war-sword,
_the_ far-fam’d man,
_the_ hard-edged, have:
I will with Hrunting me
work renown,
or me death shall take.”
After those words
_the_ Weder-Goths’ lord
with ardour hasten’d,	[2990]
nor answer
would await:
_the_ ocean-surge receiv’d
_the_ warlike man.
Then was a day’s space
ere he the ground-plain
could perceive.
Forthwith discover’d
_she_ who _the_ floods’ course
bloodthirsty had held	[3000]
_a_ hundred years,
fierce and greedy,
that there _a_ man
_the_ country of strange creatures
was from above exploring;
then grasp’d towards _him_,
_the_ warrior seiz’d		{100/101}
in _her_ horrid clutches:
_yet_ not the sooner did _she_ penetrate
_the_ sound body,	[3010]
_for the_ ring- _mail_ protected _him_ without,
_so_ that she that war-case
might not pierce through,
_the_ lock’d limb-sark,
with _her_ hostile fingers.
Bore then the sea-wolf,
when she to _the_ bottom came,
_the_ prince of rings
to her dwelling,
so _that_ he might not	[3020]
(resolute as he was)
his weapons command;
but him therefore many wondrous beings
oppress’d in _the_ deep,
many _a_ sea-beast
with _its_ battle-tusks
_the_ martial sark brake,
_the_ miserable beings pursued _him_.
Then the warrior found
that he in _a_ hostile hall,	[3030]
_he_ knew not what, was,
where him no water
_in_ aught could scathe,
nor him for _the_ roofed-hall
could touch		{101/102}
_the_ flood’s sudden gripe;
_he_ saw _a_ fire-light,
_a_ pale beam,
brightly shine:
then the good _warrior_ perceiv’d	[3040]
_the_ ground-wolf,
_the_ mighty mere-wife;
_he_ made _a_ powerful onslaught
with _his_ war-falchion;
_the_ sword-blow withheld not,
_so_ that on her head
_the_ ringed brand sang
_a_ horrid war-song.
Then the guest found
that the war-beam	[3050]
would not bite,
life injure,
but _that_ the edge fail’d
_its_ lord at need;
erst _it_ had endur’d many
hand-encounters,
_the_ helmet often slash’d,
_the_ fated’s war-garb;
then was _the_ first time
for _the_ precious treasure,	[3060]
that its power fail’d.
Again was resolute,
slacken’d not _his_ ardour,
of _his_ great deeds mindful,
Hygelac’s kinsman;
cast then _the_ twisted brand,
curiously bound,		{102/103}
_the_ angry champion,
_so_ that on _the_ earth it lay
stiff and steel-edged,	[3070]
in _his_ strength he trusted,
in _his_ hand-gripe of power;
so must _a_ man do,
when in battle he
thinks of gaining
lasting praise,
nor about his life cares,
Seiz’d then by _the_ shoulder,
(_he_ reck’d not of _her_ malice)
_the_ war-Goths’ lord,	[3080]
Grendel’s mother:
then _the_ fierce warrior drag’d
(as he was incens’d,)
_the_ mortal foe,
_so_ that on _the_ place she bow’d.
She him again quickly
paid _a_ hand-reward
with _her_ fierce grasps,
and at him caught:
overthrew then _the_ weary of mood,	[3090]
of warriors strongest,
_the_ active champion,
_so_ that he was about to perish.
_She_ then press’d down the hall-guest,		{103/104}
and her poniard drew,
broad, brown-edged;
_she_ would avenge her son,
_her_ only offspring.
On his shoulder lay
_the_ braided breast-net,	[3100]
which _his_ life protected,
against point and against edge
entrance withstood.
Had then perish’d
Ecgtheow’s son
under _the_ spacious ground,
_the_ Goths’ champion,
had not him _his_ martial byrnie
help afforded,
_his_ war-net hard,	[3110]
and holy God
in war triumphant, rul’d;
_the_ wise Lord,
Ruler of _the_ skies,
decided it with justice
easily,
when he again stood up.			XXIII.
Then saw _he_ among _the_ arms
_a_ victorious falchion,
an old eotenish sword	[3120]
of edges doughty,
_the_ pride of warriors;		{104/105}
that [was] of weapons choicest,
save it was greater than
any other man
to _the_ game of war
might bear forth,
good and elegant,
_the_ work of giants.
Then seiz’d he _the_ knotted hilt,	[3130]
_the_ Scyldings’ warrior;
fierce and deadly grim,
_the_ ringed brand _he_ drew,
of life hopeless
angrily struck,
_so_ that against her neck
_it_ grip’d _her_ hard,
_her_ bone-rings brake,
_the_ falchion pass’d through all
_her_ fated carcase: 	[3140]
on _the_ ground she sank.
_The_ sword was gory,
_the_ warrior in _his_ work rejoiced;
the beam shone,
light stood within,
even as from heaven
serenely shines
_the_ candle of _the_ firmament.
He through _the_ dwelling look’d;
then by _the_ wall turn’d,	[3150]
_his_ weapon rais’d
hard by _the_ hilt,
Hygelac’s thane,
angry and resolv’d;		{105/106}
(nor was the edge useless
to the warrior;)
for he would forthwith
Grendel requite for
_the_ many onslaughts
that he had made	[3160]
on _the_ West-Danes,
oftener by much
than on one occasion,
when he Hrothgar’s
hearth-enjoyers
slew in _their_ rest,
sleeping devour’d
of _the_ Danes’ folk
fifteen men,
and as many others	[3170]
convey’d away,
hateful offerings.
He had for that paid him _his_ reward,
_the_ fierce champion,
so well that on _his_ couch he saw,
of contest weary,
Grendel lying
lifeless,
as had for him before decided
_the_ conflict at Heorot.	[3180]
(_The_ corpse sprang far away,
when after death he
_the_ stroke suffer’d,
_the_ hard sword-blow,)		{106/107}
and him then sever’d from _his_ head.
Saw it forthwith
_the_ sagacious men,
those who with Hrothgar,
were on _the_ water looking,
that _the_ wave-blending was	[3190]
all mingled,
_the_ deep stain’d with blood;
_the_ grizzly hair’d,
_the_ old, about _the_ good _warrior_
together spake,
that of the noble they
expected not again,
that he in victory exulting,
would come to seek
_their_ great prince;	[3200]
as of this _it_ was _a_ notice,
that him the seawolf
had destroy’d.
Then came _the_ noon of day,
left _the_ headland
_the_ bold Scyldings;
departed home thence
_the_ gold-friend of men,
_his_ guests to seek,
sick of mood,	[3210]
and on _the_ mere _they_ gaz’d,
wish’d and ween’d not that they
their dear lord
himself should see.		{107/108}
Then that sword began
after _with_ battle-gore
in icicles of blood,
_that_ war-falchion, to fade away;
(that was a miracle!)
_so_ that it all melted	[3220]
to ice most like,
when _the_ frost’s band
_the_ Father relaxes,
unwinds _the_ wave-ropes,
who has power
of times and seasons;
that is _the_ true Creator.
He took not in those dwellings,
_the_ Weder-Goths’ lord.
more treasures,	[3230]
(though he there many saw,)
except _the_ head,
and _the_ hilt also,
with treasure variegated;
_the_ sword had already melted,
_the_ drawn brand was burnt;
so hot was the blood,
_so_ venomous _the_ stranger guest,
who therein had perish’d.
Forthwith was afloat	[3240]
he who before at strife awaited
_the_ battle-fall of foes;
_he_ div’d up through _the_ water,
_the_ wave-blendings were
all clear’d,
_the_ vast dwellings,		{108/109}
when the stranger guest
left _her_ life-days,
and this miserable creation.
Came then to land	[3250]
_the_ sailors’ refuge,
stoutly swimming,
in _his_ sea-offerings rejoiced,
_his_ mighty burthen,
of the _spoils_ that he had with him.
Went then towards him,
thank’d God,
_the_ stout band of thanes,
in _their_ lord rejoiced,
for that they him sound
might see.	[3261]
Then was from the vigorous _chief_
helm and byrnie
quickly loosed,
_the_ stream trickled down,
water under _the_ clouds,
stain’d with deadly gore.
_They_ went forth thence,
with _their_ foot-steps,
(in _their_ souls rejoicing,)	[3270]
_the_ high-way measur’d,
_the_ well-known road;
_the_ nobly bold men,
from the sea-shore,
bore _the_ heads,
with difficulty
to each of them,		{109/110}
of _those_ much-daring _ones_:
four must,
on the deadly stake,	[3280]
laboriously convey
to _the_ gold-hall
Grendel’s head;
until at once
to _the_ hall came
stout active in warfare
fourteen
Goths marching,
with _their_ lord:
proud in _the_ throng	[3290]
_he_ trod _the_ meadow-plains.
Then came entering
_the_ prince of thanes,
_the_ deed-bold man,
with glory honour’d,
_the_ human war-beast,
Hrothgar to greet.
Then by _the_ locks was
into _the_ court borne
Grendel’s head,	[3300]
where men were drinking,
terrific before _the_ warriors,
and the woman’s also;
_an_ aspect wonderful to see
men look’d on.			XXIV.
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
“Behold, we thee these sea-offerings,		{110/111}
son of Healfdene,
lord of Scyldings,	[3310]
joyfully have brought,
in token of glory,
which thou here lookest on.
I it hardly
with life escap’d from,
_the_ conflict under water,
with pain ventur’d on _it_;
with difficulty
according to right had been
_the_ contest parted,	[3320]
had not God shielded me.
I might not in _the_ conflict
with Hrunting
aught accomplish,
though that weapon be good;
but me granted
the, Ruler of men,
that on the wall I saw
hang beautiful
_an_ old powerful sword,	[3330]
(full oft has _He_ directed
_the_ friendless,)
_and_ that I the weapon drew.
_I_ slew then in that conflict
(as me _the_ opportunity requited)
_the_ house’s keepers;
then that battle-falchion,
that drawn brand, was burnt up,
as the blood sprang,
hottest of hostile gores:	[3340]	{111/112}
I the hilt thence
from _the_ foes bore away,
avenged _the_ crimes,
_the_ Dane’s deadly plague,
as it was fitting.
I now promise it thee,
that thou in Heorot may’st
sleep secure
with _the_ company of thy warriors,
and every thane	[3350]
of thy people,
noble and youthful;
_so_ that for them thou needest not to fear,
_O_ prince of Scyldings,
on that side,
_the_ life’s bane of _thy_ warriors,
as thou erst didst.”
Then was _the_ golden hilt
to _the_ aged warrior,
_the_ hoar war-leader,	[3360]
in hand given,
_the_ giants work of old:
it pass’d into _the_ possession,
after _those_ devils’ fall,
of _the_ Danes’ lord,
_the_ work of wondrous smiths;
and when this world resign’d
_the_ fierce hearted man,
God’s denier,
of murder guilty,	[3370]
and his mother eke,
_it_ pass’d into _the_ power
of worldly kings		{112/113}
the best
between _the_ seas,
of those who in Scania
treasures dealt.
Hrothgar spake,
gaz’d on _the_ hilt,
_the_ old relic,	[3380]
on which _the_ origin was written
of _the_ ancient war,
after _the_ flood had slain,
_the_ flowing ocean,
_the_ giants’ race;
insolently _they_ bore them.
that was _a_ people strange
to _the_ eternal Lord;
to them, therefore, _a_ final reward,
through _the_ water’s rage,	[3390]
_the_ Almighty gave,
So was on the mounting
of bright gold,
in runic letters,
rightly mark’d,
set and said,
for whom that sword,
of irons choicest,
first was wrought,
with hilt bound round and serpentine.	[3400]
Then spake the wise		{113/114}
son of Healfdene:
(all were silent)
“Lo, that may say,
he who truth and right
practises among people,
far back all remembers,
_an_ old country’s guardian,
that this earl should have been
born better.	[3410]
Thy glory is exalted
through wide ways,
my friend Beowulf,
over every nation.
Thou supportest it all patiently,
thy might, with prudence of mind.
I shall evince to thee my
love, even as we two have said:
thou shalt for _a_ comfort be,
_a_ very long time,	[3420]
to thy people,
for _a_ help to warriors.
Not so was Heremod
to Ecgwela’s children,
_a_ blessing to the Scyldings;
he wax’d not for their benefit,
but for _their_ slaughter,
and for _a_ deadly plague
to _the_ Danes’ people;
_he_ in angry mood destroy’d	[3430]	{114/115}
_his_ table sharers,
_his_ nearest friends,
until he lonely departed,
_the_ great prince,
from _the_ joys of men;
although him mighty God
with _the_ delights of power,
with energies had exalted,
above all men
advanced _him_;	[3440]
yet in his soul _there_ grew
_a_ sanguinary heart;
he gave no rings
to _the_ Danes according to desert:
joyless _he_ continued,
_so_ that of war he
_the_ misery suffer’d,
_a_ longsome public bale.
Teach thou thyself by this _man_,
understand munificence.	[3450]
This strain of thee I
in winters wise have recited.
Wonderful ’tis to say
how mighty God,
to _the_ race of men,
through _his_ ample mind,
dispenses wisdom,
land and valour:
He possesses power of all;
sometimes He as it likes	[3460]
lets wander
_the_ mind’s thought of man,		{115/116}
of _the_ great race,
gives him in _his_ country
joy of earth
to possess,
_a_ shelter-city of men;
thus makes to him subject
_the_ portions of _the_ world,
ample realms,	[3470]
_so_ that he himself may not,
through his lack of wisdom,
think of _his_ end:
he continues in feasting,
nor him _in_ aught afflicts,
disease or age,
nor for him guileful care
in _his_ mind darkens,
nor strife anywhere
shows hostile hate;	[3480]
but for him all _the_ world
turns at _his_ will;
he _the_ worse knows not,			XXV.
Until within him
_a_ deal of arrogance
grows and buds,
when the guardian sleeps,
_the_ soul’s keeper;
too fast is the sleep
bound by cares,	[3490]
_the_ slayer very near,
who from _his_ arrow-bow,		{116/117}
wickedly shoots;
then will _he_ be in _the_ breast,
beneath _the_ helm stricken,
with _the_ bitter shaft;
_he_ cannot guard himself
from _the_ wicked wondrous commands
of _the_ cursed spirit;
seems to him too little	[3500]
what he too long had held,
fierce-minded _he_ covets,
gives not in _his_ pride
rich rings,
and he the future state
forgets and neglects,
because God to him before has given,
Ruler of glory,
_a_ deal of dignities.
It in _the_ final close	[3510]
afterwards befals,
that the body
miserably sinks,
fated falls;
another succeeds,
who without reluctance
treasures dispenses,
_the_ warrior’s former gains,
terror heeds not.
Keep from thee that baleful evil,	[3520]
dear Beowulf,
best of warriors,		{117/118}
and choose for thee the better,
eternal counsels;
heed not arrogance,
renown’d champion!
now is _the_ flower of thy might
for a while;
eftsoons ’t will be that thee
disease or sword	[3530]
from _thy_ energy separates,
or fire’s clutch,
or rage of flood,
or falchion’s gripe,
or arrow’s flight,
or dire age,
or twinkling of eyes,
oppresses and darkens:
suddenly _it_ will be:
that thee, warrior,	[3540]
death overpowers.
Thus I _the_ Ring-Danes
for half _a_ hundred years
had rul’d under _the_ clouds,
and them from war secur’d
from many tribes
throughout this mid-earth,
with spears and swords,
_so_ that I me any,
under heaven’s course,	[3550]
adversary counted not.
Lo, to me of this in _my_ country
_a_ reverse came,
sadness after merriment,		{118/119}
since Grendel became,
_my_ old adversary,
my invader:
I for that visitation
constantly have borne
great mental care;	[3560]
therefore be to _the_ Creator thanks,
to _the_ eternal Lord,
for that I have remain’d in life,
that I on that head,
clotted with gore,
after _our_ old contention,
with _my_ eyes may gaze.
Go now to _thy_ seat,
enjoy _the_ pleasure of _the_ feast,
for battle honour’d:	[3570]
for us two shall a great many
common treasures _be_,
when _it_ shall be morning.”
_The_ Goth was glad of mood,
went straightways to
occupy _his_ seat,
as the sage commanded.
Then were again as before,
the valour-fam’d
court-residents,	[3580]
fairly feasted,
with new spirit.
_The_ helm of night grew murky
dark o’er _the_ vassals,
_the_ courtiers all arose;		{119/120}
_the_ grizzly hair’d _prince_ would
_his_ bed visit,
_the_ aged Scylding;
_the_ Goth immeasurably well
_the_ renown’d shield-warrior	[3590]
wished to rest.
Forthwith _the_ hall-thane him,
from _his_ journey weary,
_the_ comer from afar,
guided forth,
who from reverence
had all _things_ provided
for _the_ thane’s need,
such as in that day
navigators of _the_ main	[3600]
should have.
Rested him then _the_ ample-hearted;
_the_ mansion tower’d,
vaulted and golden-hued:
_the_ guest slept therein,
until _the_ black raven
heaven’s delight
blithe of heart announced
_the_ bright [sun] coming,
robbers fleeing away.	[3610]
[ _The_ warriors] hasten’d,
_the_ nobles were
again to _their_ people		{120/121}
anxious to go;
would far from thence
_the_ high-soul’d guest
_his_ vessel visit.
Bade then the bold _chief_
Hrunting be borne,
_the_ son of Ecglaf	[3620]
bade take _back_ his sword,
_the_ precious iron;
gave him for the loan thanks,
said _that_ he the war-friend
accounted good,
in battle powerful;
nor with words blam’d _he_
_the_ falchion’s edge:
that was _a_ high-soul’d warrior,
And when eager for departure,	[3630]
with arms all ready
_the_ warriors were,
went to _the_ West-Danes
_the_ noble running, to
where the other was,
_the_ human war-beast:
_he_ Hrothgar greeted.			XXVI.
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:		{121/122}
“Now to thee _we_ sea-farers	[3640]
desire to say,
_we_ comers from afar,
that we are most desirous
Hygelac to seek;
we have here been kindly,
cordially, serv’d,
thou hast well treated us.
If I now on earth
in aught can,
for thy mind’s love,	[3650]
execute more,
O lord of men,
than I yet have done,
of warlike works,
I shall be straightways ready;
if I learn,
over _the_ floods’ course,
that thee _those_ dwelling around
with terror urge,
as _those_ hating thee	[3660]
at times have done,
I to thee thousands
of warriors will bring,
of heroes, to _thy_ help.
I know of Hygelac,
lord of Goths,
although he be _a_ young
shepherd of _his_ folk,
that he will enable me,
by words and works,	[3670]
that I may well defend thee,		{122/123}
and to thee for succour
_the_ javelin-shaft bear,
_a_ support to _thy_ power,
if thou have need of men.
If then Hrethric
at _the_ Goths’ courts,
_the_ king’s son, craves _it_,
he may there many
friends find:	[3680]
far countries are,
better _when_ sought,
to him who on himself relies.”
Hrothgar spake
to him in answer:
“To thee those words
_the_ wise Lord
into _thy_ mind has sent;
never have I heard more prudently,
in so young _a_ life,	[3690]
_a_ man discourse.
Thou art strong of might,
and in mind sage,
wise of verbal utterances:
I think _there is_ expectation,
if it happen,
that the dart take,
war fiercely grim,
Hrethel’s offspring,
disease or iron,	[3700]
thy prince,		{123/124}
_his_ people’s shepherd,
and thou thy life hast,
that the Sea-Goths
will not have _a_ better
to choose,
not any king,
or treasure-ward of heroes:
if thou wilt hold
_thy_ kinsmen’s realm.	[3710]
Me thy mind
pleases _the_ longer _the_ better,
dear Beowulf:
thou hast borne _thyself_
_so_ that for the nations shall
(_the_ Goths’ people
and _the_ Gar-Danes)
peace _be_ to both,
and contention rest,
_the_ guileful enmities,	[3720]
which they erst have borne,
_shall_ be while I rule
_the_ ample realm,
treasures common;
many _a one_ another
greet with benefits;
over _the_ gannet’s bath
_the_ ring- _prow’d_ bark shall,
o’er _the_ main, bring
gifts and love-tokens.	[3730]
I the nations know
both towards foe and towards friend
fast constituted,		{124/125}
blameless in everything,
in _the_ old wise.”
To him besides _the_ warriors protector
gave to possess,
_the_ son of Healfdene,
treasures twelve;
bade him with the gifts
_his_ own people	[3741]
seek in safety;
quickly come again.
Kiss’d then
_the_ king nobly good,
_the_ Scyldings’ prince,
_the_ best of thanes,
and round _the_ neck _him_ took;
tears fell from him,
_the_ grizzly hair’d _prince_;	[3750]
he had hope of both,
_the_ old sage,
_but_ of _the_ second stronger,
that _they_ themselves afterwards
might see,
_the_ lofty _ones_, in conference.
To him was _the_ man so dear,
that he the fervour of his breast
might not restrain;
but in his bosom,	[3760]
fast in bonds of thought,
after _the_ dear man,		{125/126}
longing secretly
burn’d against blood.
Beowulf thence,
_the_ warrior proud with gold,
trod _the_ grassy mould,
in treasure exulting.
_The_ sea-ganger awaited
_its_ owning lord,	[3770]
which at anchor rode.
Then was on _the_ way
_the_ gift of Hrothgar
often prized.
That was a king
in everything faultless,
until age him took
from _the_ delights of vigour,
which oft had overpower’d many.			XXVII.
Came then to _the_ flood	[3780]
many proud
bachelors;
ring-nets _they_ bore,
clos’d limb-sarks.
_The_ land-warden perceiv’d
_the_ warriors’ return,
as he before had done:		{126/127}
not with insult he,
from _the_ hill’s point,
greeted _the_ guest,	[3790]
but towards him rode;
bade welcome then
to _the_ Weders’ people.
Departing, _the_ bright-clad _warriors_
went to _the_ ship,
Then was on _the_ sand
_the_ sea-curv’d bark
laden with martial weeds,
_the_ ringed prow,
with steeds and treasures;	[3800]
_the_ mast tower’d
over Hrothgar’s
hoard-treasures.
He to the boat-guard,
bound with gold,
gave _a_ sword,
_so_ that he was afterwards,
on _the_ mead-bench,
the worthier for _the_ treasure,
_the_ heritable relic.	[3810]
_He_ departed in _the_ bark,
agitating _the_ deep water,
_the_ Danes’ land left.
Then was by _the_ mast
a sea-mantle,
_a_ sail, by _a_ cord fast:		{127/128}
_the_ sea-wood rattled;
not there _the_ wave-floater
_the_ wind above _the_ billows
from its course parted:	[3820]
_the_ sea-ganger went,
floated _the_ foamy neck’d
forth o’er _the_ wave,
_the_ bounden prow
over ocean’s streams,
_so_ that they _the_ Goths’ shores
might perceive,
_the_ known headlands.
_The_ vessel press’d up,
weather-beaten	[3830]
on land _it_ stood.
Quickly at _the_ sea was
_the_ hithe-guard ready,
who, _a_ long time before,
_the_ dear men’s
(prompt at _the_ shore)
course had beheld:
_he_ bound to _the_ sand
_the_ broad-bosom’d ship
with anchor-bonds fast,	[3840]
lest it _the_ billows’ force,
_the_ gallant wood,
might wreck.
_He_ then bade be borne up
_the_ nobles’ treasures,
ornaments and rich gold:
he had not far thence		{128/129}
to seek
_the_ dispenser of treasure,
Hygelac, Hrethel’s son,	[3850]
where at home dwelt,
himself with _his_ companions,
near _the_ sea-wall.
_The_ mansion was excellent,
_a_ chief renown’d _the_ king,
high _the_ hall;
Hygd very young,
wise, well-nurtur’d,
though winters few
amid _the_ burgh-encloser	[3860]
had abided
Hæreth’s daughter:
although she was not mean,
nor of gifts too sparing
to _the_ Goths’ people,
of treasure-acquisitions,
_yet_ violence of mood mov’d
_the_ folk’s bold queen,
crime appalling.
No one durst that	[3870]
beast address,
of _the_ dear companions,
save _her_ wedded lord,
who on her daily
with eyes gaz’d;
but to him _a_ death band
decreed, calculated,		{129/130}
hand-bound,
was quickly after,
after _the_ hand-grasp,	[3880]
with _the_ sword resolv’d;
_so_ that it _the_ pernicious brand
must decide,
_the_ deadly bale make known:
such is no feminine usage
for _a_ woman to practise,
although she be beautiful,
that _a_ peace-weaver
machinate _to deprive_ of life,
after burning anger,	[3890]
_a_ dear man;
at least with that reproach’d _her_
Hemming’s son,
_while_ drinking ale;
others said,
that she dire evils
less perpetrated,
guileful iniquities,
after _she_ was first
given gold-adorn’d	[3900]
to _the_ young warrior,
the noble beast,
after she Offa’s court,		{130/131}
over _the_ fallow flood,
through _her_ father’s counsel,
by journey sought,
where she afterwards well
on _the_ throne,
_the_ good _and_ great
life’s creations	[3910]
living enjoy’d,
high love entertain’d
towards _the_ prince of heroes,
of all mankind,
as I have heard,
the best
between _the_ seas,
of _the_ human race;
for Offa was,
for gifts and wars,	[3920]
(_a_ bold man in arms)
widely honour’d;
_he_ in wisdom held
his country;
from him Eomer sprang
_for_ help to heroes,
Heming’s son,
Garmund’s grandson,
mighty in conflicts.		{131/132}	XXVIII.
Departed then the hold _warrior_
with his chosen band,	[3931]
himself along _the_ sand,
_the_ sea-plain treading,
_the_ wide shores.
_The_ world’s candle shone,
_the_ sun from _the_ south hastening:
they dragg’d on _their_ way,
resolutely went,
until _the_ protector of men,
_the_ slayer of Ongentheow,	[3940]
within _his_ burghs,
_the_ young martial king,
_the_ good, they had heard,
was rings dispensing.
To Hygelac was
Beowulf’s voyage
speedily made known,
that there into _the_ place
_the_ protector of warriors,
_his_ shield-companion,	[3950]
was come alive,
whole from _the_ game of war
proceeding to _his_ mansion.
Quickly was clear’d,
as the chief commanded,
for _the_ pedestrian guests
_the_ hall within.
Sat then facing himself
he who had come safely from _the_ conflict,		{132/133}
kinsman facing kinsman.	[3960]
After _his_ liege lord,
in sonorous speech,
_his_ faithful _friend_ had greeted,
in powerful words,
with mead-libations went,
through the hall,
Hæreth’s daughter:
_she_ lov’d the people,
_the_ wine-cup bare
to _the_ high _chief’s_ hand.	[3970]
Hygelac began
his guest
in the high hall
kindly to question:
curiosity was bursting him,
_as to_ what _the_ Sea-Goths’
courses had been.
“How befel _it_ you on _the_ way,
dear Beowulf,
when thou suddenly	[3980]
didst resolve afar
conflict to seek
over _the_ salt water,
contest at Heorot,
that thou to Hrothgar
_his_ wide-known calamity
mightest somewhat compensate,
_the_ great prince?
I on this account _my_ mind’s care
have in sorrow-boilings seeth’d;	[3990]	{133/134}
_I_ trusted not in _the_ voyage
of _the_ dear man;
I pray’d thee long,
that thou the deadly guest
shouldest in no wise greet,
_but_ let _the_ South Danes
themselves decide
_the_ contest with Grendel.
To God I say thanks,
for that I thee sound	[4000]
might see.”
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
“It is not secret,
_my_ lord Hygelac,
[our] meeting
to many men,
what while [of conflict]
of myself and Grendel
was on the place,	[4010]
where he _a_ great abundance,
to _the_ victorious Scyldings,
had of sorrow caus’d,
misery everlasting.
I have avenged all that,
so _that_ need not boast
of Grendel’s kinsmen
any on earth
of that twilight tumult,
who shall longest live	[4020]
of _the_ hateful race.
With perils encompass’d,
I had but just come there,
to the ring-hall,
Hrothgar to greet
_when_ forthwith to me the great
son of Healfdene,
after he my
mind’s purpose knew,
opposite his own son	[4030]
_a_ seat assign’d.
_The_ company was joyous;
not in _my_ life have I seen
under heaven’s vault,
of hall-sitters
_a_ mead-joy greater;
at times _the_ great queen,
_the_ peaceful tie of nations,
_the_ hall all travers’d,
_her_ young sons address’d;	[4040]
oft she _a_ ringed wreath
to _the_ warrior gave,
ere to _her_ seat she went.
At times before _the_ nobles
Hrothgar’s daughter
to _the_ earls in order
_the_ ale-cup bore,
whom I Freaware		{135/136}
_the_ court residents
heard name,	[4050]
where she bright treasure
to _the_ warriors gave:
she was promis’d,
young, gold-adorn’d,
to _the_ glad son of Froda;
therefore is _he_ become
_the_ Scylding’s friend,
_the_ kingdom’s shepherd;
and that report tells,
that with the wife he	[4060]
_a_ deal of deadly feuds
_and_ strifes has allay’d;
though seldom anywhere,
after _a_ people’s fall.
_even_ for _a_ little while
_the_ fatal dart ceases,
although the bride be good.			XXX.
* * *
* * *
This then may ill endure
_the_ Heathobeards’ prince		{136/137}
and every thane
of those peoples,
when with _the_ woman he
walks in _the_ court,
_the_ Dane’s princely child,
by _the_ noble served
on him girds
_the_ relic of _the_ old,
hard and ring-mail’d,	[4080]
_the_ treasure of the Heathobeards,
while they those weapons
might command,
until they misled
to the shield-play
_their_ dear associates
and their own lives.
Then at _the_ beer will say
he who _the_ ring shall see,
_an_ old spear-warrior,	[4090]
who remembers all
_the_ slaughter of _the_ men,
(fierce will be his spirit,)
sad of mood will _he_ begin
of _the_ young warrior,
through _his_ bosom’s thought,
_the_ mind to prove,
war-bale waken,
and that word will say:
“Thou, my friend, mightest	[4100]
_the_ falchion know,
which thy father
bore to the fight
under _the_ martial helm,
for _the_ last time,
_the_ dear iron,
where _the_ Danes him slew,
were masters of _the_ slaughter place,
when Withergyld had perish’d,
after _the_ fall of heroes,	[4110]
the bold Scyldings.
Now here of those murderers
_the_ son, I know not whose
in arms exulting
walks in the court,
of _the_ slaughter boasts,
and the treasure bears,
which thou with right
shouldst command.”
Thus prompts _he_ and reminds,
on every occasion,	[4121]
with painful words,
until _the_ time comes,
when _the_ fated thane,
for _his_ father’s deeds,
after _the_ falchion’s bite,
blood-stain’d sleeps,
to death condemn’d.
Thence the other
warrior escapes,	[4130]
he the land well knows.
Then will be broken,
on both sides,
_the_ oath-swearing of warriors.
Afterwards in Ingeld		{138/139}
deadly hates will boil,
and his woman’s love,
after _the_ heats of care,
will become cooler.
Therefore I _the_ Heathobeards’	[4140]
affection esteem not,
_nor_ part of lordly kinship
to _the_ Danes guileless,
_their_ friendship fast.
I shall _now_ speak on
again about Grendel,
that thou well mayst know,
O dispenser of treasure,
how afterwards fell out
_the_ hand conflict of warriors.	[4150]
After heaven’s gem
had glided o’er _the_ earth,
_the_ guest came angry,
_the_ giant fierce at eve,
to visit us,
where we sound
guarded _the_ hall:
there was _his_ glove
in _the_ war not idle,
_a_ life-bale to _the_ fated:	[4160]
who foremost lay,		{139/140}
_a_ girded champion,
to him was Grendel,
to _my_ great fellow-thane,
_a_ mouth-murderer;
_the_ belov’d man’s
body _he_ all swallow’d;
nor yet for that the earlier out,
empty-handed,
_the_ bloody-tooth’d murderer,	[4170]
of evils mindful,
from that gold-hall
would go;
but he, proud of _his_ might,
trial made of me,
grasp’d ready-handed,
_his_ glove hung
wide and wondrous,
with curious bindings fast;
it was cunningly	[4180]
all prepared
with _a_ devil’s crafts
and dragon’s skins:
he me there within
unsinning,
_the_ brutal perpetrator,
would make
one of many:		{140/141}
it might not so _be_,
when in anger I	[4190]
upright stood.
Too long is _it_ to recount
how [I] to the miscreant,
for every evil,
paid _a_ manual reward;
there I, my prince,
thy people
honour’d by _my_ works.
He escap’d away;
for _a_ little while	[4200]
life’s pleasures enjoy’d;
yet his right hand
guarded on _his_ track
in Heorot,
and he humble thence,
sad of mood,
_to the_ lake-ground fell.
Me for that deadly onslaught
_the_ Scyldings’ friend
with rich gold	[4210]
abundantly rewarded,
with many treasures,
after morning came,
and we to _the_ feast
had sat.
There was song and glee,
_the_ aged Scylding,
much inquiring,
related _things_ from _times_ remote,
at whiles _the_ beast of war	[4220]
_the_ joy of harp
greeted, the wood of mirth,		{141/142}
sometimes _the_ lay recited
sooth and sorrowful;
sometimes _a_ wondrous tale
told in order due
the liberal-hearted king;
sometimes again began,
by age restrain’d,
_the_ old warrior	[4230]
with _the_ youth to speak,
_the_ strength of war;
_his_ breast within _him_ boil’d,
when he in winters wise
many things call’d to mind.
So we therein
_the_ livelong day
in enjoyment pass’d,
until night came
_the_ second to men.	[4240]
Then was in turn quickly
ready with wily vengeance
Grendel’s mother;
_she_ journey’d sorrowful;
_her_ son death had taken,
_the_ Weders’ hostile hate:
_the_ monster woman
her child avenged,
_a_ warrior slew
daringly.	[4250]
There was from Æschere,
_the_ sage ancient councillor,
life departed;
nor there might they him,
when morning came,		{142/143}
_the_ death-weary _one_,
_the_ Dane’s people
with fire consume,
nor on _the_ pile raise
the dear man:	[4260]
she the corpse bore away,
_the_ fiend’s parent,
there under _the_ mountain stream.
That was to Hrothgar
of sorrows saddest,
of those which _the_ nation’s chief
had long o’erwhelmed:
Then the prince me,
by thy life,
besought, fierce of mood,	[4270]
that in _the_ throng of waters I
would _a_ valorous deed perform,
_my_ life would venture,
great glory achieve:
he me _a_ meed promis’d,
I then of the boiling _deep_,
which is widely known,
_the_ grim, horrific
ground-keeper found;
there we had _a_ while	[4280]
_a_ hand-conflict;
_the_ water bubbled with blood,
and from _her_ head I cut,
in that battle-hall.		{143/144}
Grendel’s mother
with powerful edge;
with difficulty thence
_I my_ life bore away:
I was not yet doom’d
but me _the_ protector of warriors	[4290]
again gave
many treasures,
Healfdene’s son.			XXXI.
So the great king
becomingly liv’d;
not the rewards
had I lost,
_the_ meed of might;
for he me [treasures] gave,
Healfdene’s son,	[4300]
in [my] own power,
which I to thee, warrior-king,
will bring,
with gladness make ready;
moreover of thee are all
_my_ pleasures long:
I have few
near kinsmen,
save thee, Hygelac.”
Bade then in be borne	[4310]
_the_ boar-head banner,
_the_ warlike towering helm,		{144/145}
_the_ [martial] byrnie,
_the_ splendid battle-sword;
_this_ speech afterward recited:
“To me this war-gear
Hrothgar gave;
_the_ sagacious prince
some _things_ by word commanded,
that I to thee his errand	[4320]
again should say:
said that it had had
king Hiorogar,
_the_ Scyldings’ lord
for _a_ long while:
_yet_ not the sooner to his son
would he give,
to _the_ bold Heoroweard,
though he to him was kind,
_these_ breast-weeds:	[4330]
enjoy _it_ all well!”
I heard that of _these_ appointments
four steeds,
swift alike,
follow’d _the_ track,
apple-fallow.
He gave to him _a_ present
of steeds and treasures.
So should _a_ kinsman do,
not _a_ net of treachery	[4340]
for another braid		{145/146}
with secret craft,
death * *
for _an_ associate.
Was to Hygelac,
_the_ bold in conflicts,
_his_ nephew very affectionate,
and each to other
mindful of benefits.
I heard that he the neck-ring	[4350]
to Hygd gave,
_the_ curious, wondrous treasure,
which to him Wealhtheow had given,
_a_ prince’s daughter,
together with three horses,
black and with saddles bright:
was then,
after _the_ presentation of rings,
_her_ breast honour’d.
Thus flourish’d	[4360]
Ecgtheow’s son,
_the_ man known in wars,
for good deeds;
_he_ acted after judgment;
nor struck _he the_ drunken
enjoyers of _his_ hearth;		{146/147}
his was no rugged soul,
but he of mankind
_the_ greatest strength,
_the_ ample gift,	[4370]
that God had given him,
possess’d, _the_ beast of war.
Long was _the_ shame,
when him the sons of the Goths
not good accounted,
nor him on _the_ mead-bench
of much worthy
_the_ Lord of hosts
would make;
very [oft _they_ said]	[4380]
that he was slack,
_a_ sluggish prince:
_a_ reverse came
to _the_ glorious man
of every grievance.
Bade then _the_ protector of warriors
fetch in,
_the_ war-fam’d king,
Hrathel’s relic,
with gold adorn’d;	[4390]
_there_ was then not among _the_ Goths
a better treasure
of _a_ sword’s kind;
which he on Beowulf’s
bosom laid,		{147/148}
and to him gave
seven thousand,
_a_ habitation and _a_ princely seat.
To them both together was
in the community	[4400]
_the_ land natural,
the patrimonial right
in _the_ one stronger,
the ample realm
his, who there was the better.
Afterwards that pass’d away,
in later days,
in war’s tumults,
when Hygelac had fall’n,
and to Heardred	[4410]
battle-falchions,
under _the_ shield,
became _the_ bane,
when him sought
among _the_ victor-people,
bold-daring warriors,
_the_ martial Scylfings
quell’d in wars
Hereric’s nephew.
Afterwards of Beowulf	[4420]
_the_ broad realm
into _the_ hand devolv’d:		{148/149}
he held _it_ well
fifty winters;
that was _a_ wise king,
_an_ old land-guardian,
until one began,
in _the_ dark nights,
_a_ dragon, to hold sway,
which in _a_ heap	[4430]
_his_ hoard watch’d over;
_a_ steep stone mount
_the_ path lay beneath,
to men unknown.
There within went
of men I know not who
* * *
to _the_ heathen hoard
* * *
* * *	[4440]
he that after
sleeping by _the_ fire,
_the_ guardian of crimes
by a thief’s craft,
that * *
* * *
that he was angry.			XXXII.
Not spontaneously,
_the_ worm-hoards’ craft,
of his own will,	[4450]	{149/150}
he who * * *
but from dire need
* * I know not of what,
sons of men,
hateful strokes
* * *
and therein *
* * *
forthwith look’d in
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
There of such were many,
in that earth-cave,
ancient treasures,
as he in days of yore,
what man I know not,
_the_ great legacy	[4460]
of _a_ noble race,
thoughtful,
there had hidden,
precious treasures.
Death had taken them all,
in former times,
and the one at length
of peoples’ nobles,
who there longest wander’d,
was _a_ sad man;	[4470]	{150/151}
_he_ wish’d for _a_ delay,
that he _a_ little space
longer _the_ treasures
might enjoy.
_The_ mound all ready
stood on the plain,
near to _the_ water-waves,
down by _the_ headland,
fast by arts stringent:
there within bore	[4480]
_the_ earl _his_ treasures,
_the_ guardian of rings,
_the_ heap-found portion
of rich gold;
_a_ few words said:
“Hold thou now, earth!
(now men must not)
_the_ possession of nobles;
where it erst on thee
good _men_ acquir’d;	[4490]
war-death has taken,
_a_ cruel life-bale,
every man
of my people;
of those who this life resign’d:
_they_ had seen joy of hall
* brandishing of swords,
or * *
_the_ rich cup,
_the_ precious drink-vessel,	[4500]	{151/152}
nobles valour sick:
the hard helm shall,
adorn’d with gold,
from _the_ fated fall;
mortally wounded sleep
those who war to rage
by trumpet should announce,
in like manner the war-shirt,
which in battle stood,
over _the_ crash of shields,	[4510]
the bite of swords,
shall moulder after the warrior;
_the_ byrnie’s ring may not
after _the_ martial leader
go far
on _the_ side of heroes;
_there_ is no joy of harp,
_no_ glee-wood’s mirth,
no good hawk
swings through _the_ hall,	[4520]
nor the swift steed
tramps _the_ city-place,
baleful death has
many living kinds
sent [forth].”
So, sad of mood,
_his_ afflictions bewail’d
one after all,
unblithe * *
by day and night,	[4530]	{152/153}
until death’s hand
touch’d _him_ at heart.
_The_ hoard-delight found
_the_ old twilight scather
standing open,
who burning
the naked, spiteful dragon
flies by night
in fire envelop’d;	[4540]
him _the_ land-dwellers
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
where he heathen gold
defends, with winters wise;
he has not aught
* * *
* * *
* * *
So the great scather
three hundred winters
held in _the_ earth
a hoard-house
exceeding strong,
until him enraged one	[4550]
man in mood:
to _his_ liege lord _he_ bore
_a_ rich cup,
pray’d _a_ covenant of security
of his lord.
Then was _the_ hoard explor’d,		{153/154}
_the_ hoard of rings borne off,
_the_ prayer granted
to _the_ poor man.
_The_ lord beheld	[4560]
_the_ ancient work of men
for _the_ first time.
When the worm awoke
_the_ crime had been renew’d;
_he_ then smelt along _the_ stone,
_the_ stout of heart found
_the_ foe’s foot-trace;
he had stept forth,
by secret craft,
near to _the_ dragon’s head:	[4570]
Thus may _an_ undoom’d man
easily escape from
calamity and exile,
who the Almighty’s
favour holds.
_The_ hoard-ward sought
diligently along _the_ ground,
_he the_ man would find,
him who to him in sleep
had caused pain:	[4580]
hot and savage of mood
_the_ mound _he_ oft wander’d round,
all outward;
not there any man
in that desert,		{154/155}
however, in conflict rejoiced,
in _the_ work of war;
sometimes he return’d to _the_mount,
_his_ treasure vessel sought;
he forthwith found,	[4590]
that some man had
meddled with _the_ gold,
_the_ chief treasures.
_The_ hoard- ward awaited
with difficulty
until evening came;
then was angry
_the_ mount’s guardian,
would much then
with fire requite	[4600]
dearly for _his_ drink- vessel.
Then was day departed,
after _the_ worm’s wishes;
not within _his_ mound longer
would he abide;
but with burning went,
with fire hastening.
The beginning was dreadful
to _the_ people in _the_ land,
as it quickly was,
in their treasure giver,
painfully ended.		{155/156}	XXXIII.
Then the guest began
with gleeds to vomit,
_the_ bright dwellings to burn;
_the_ fire-beam stood
in hate to men;
nothing Hving there
_the_ hostile air-flier
would leave.	[4620]
That worm’s war was
widely seen,
_the_ torturing foe’s malice,
near and far,
how the hostile scather
_the_ Goths’ people
hated and oppress’d;
_then_ darted back to _his_ hoards,
_his_ secret hall,
ere day-time.	[4630]
_He_ had _the_ land-inhabitants
in flame envelop’d,
with fire and burning;
in _his_ mount he trusted,
_his_ war and mound:
him that hope deceiv’d.
Then was to Beowulf
_the_ terror made known
speedily in sooth,
that his own home,	[4640]
of mansions best,
was by fire-heats consum’d,
_the_ Goths’ gift-chair.		{156/157}
That to the good _prince_ was
grievous in mind,
of mental sorrows greatest:
_the_ wise _chief_ ween’d
that he with _the_ Almighty,
against all right,
with _the_ eternal Lord,	[4650]
should be bitterly incens’d:
_his_ breast boil’d within
with dark thoughts,
as _it_ was not befitting him.
_The_ fire-drake had
_the_ people’s fastness,
_an_ island without,
the country’s safeguard,
with gleeds destroyed.
For this _the_ warlike king,	[4660]
_the_ Weders’ prince,
vengeance learn’d;
bade for him then be wrought
_the_ protector of warriors,
all of iron,
_the_ lord of earls,
a wondrous war-board:
he well knew
that him _the_ forest-wood
might not help,	[4670]
linden against fire.
Of _these_ miserable days must
_the_ good prince		{157/158}
an end abide,
of _this_ world’s life,
and the worm with _him_;
although _the_ hoard-wealth
_he_ long had held.
Disdain’d then
_the_ prince of rings	[4680]
that he _the_ wide-flier
wth _a_ host should seek,
a numerous band;
he dreaded not the conflict,
nor the worm’s warfare
for aught accounted,
_his_ energy and valour;
because he erst many,
rashly daring,
strifes had escap’d from,	[4690]
tumults of war,
since he Hrothgar’s
(victorious warrior)
hall had purified,
and in conflict grasp’d
Grendel’s relation,
of loathsome race.
Nor was that least
of hand-meetings,
where Hygelac was slain,	[4700]
when _the_ Goths’ king,
in war-onslaughts,
_the_ lordly friend of nations,
in _the_ Frieslands,
Hrethel’s offspring,		{158/159}
sword-drunken perish’d,
by _the_ falchion beaten.
Thence Beowulf came
by his own power,
_the_ need of swimming suffer’d;	[4710]
_he_ had on his arm
* * thirty
war-equipments
when he to _the_ sea went down.
Not the Hetwaras
had need of exultation,
in that host of war,
who in front against him
bore the linden;
few again came	[4720]
from that warlike darer,
_their_ home to visit:
swam over then _the_ seals’ course
Ecgtheow’s son,
_a_ poor solitary,
again to _his_ people,
where him Hygd offer’d
treasure and realm,
rings and princely throne:
in _her_ child _she_ trusted not,	[4730]
that he against foreign folks
_his_ paternal seats
could hold.		{159/160}
Then was Hygelac dead,
_yet_ not for that sooner _the_ poor _people_
could prevail
with the prince,
on any account,
that he to Heardred
would be lord,	[4740]
or the kingdom
would choose:
yet he him among _his_ people
with friendly instructions maintain’d,
kindly with honour;
until he became older,
_and_ rul’d _the_ Weder-Goths.
Him rovers
over the sea sought;
_the_ son of Ohthere	[4750]
they had subdued,
_the_ Scylfings’ helm,
the best
of sea-kings,
of those who in Sweden
treasure dispens’d,
_a_ great prince;
that to his marrow went:
he there fruitlessly		{160/161}
sank with _a_ mortal wound,	[4760]
with strokes of _the_ sword,
_the_ son of Hygelac;
and again departed
Ohthere’s son.
_his_ home to visit,
after Heardred had fall’n;
he the royal seat left
Beowulf to hold,
over _the_ Goths to rule:
that was _a_ good king.	[4770]		XXXIV.
He for _the_ people’s fall
retribution remember’d
in after days;
_he_ became to Eadgils
_when_ in distress _a_ friend;
with people _he_ supported,
over _the_ wide sea,
Ohthere’s son,
with warriors and weapons:
he afterwards avenged	[4780]
* * *
* * *
with cold sad fortunes,
_their_ king of life depriv’d.		{161/162}
Thus he every enmity
had outliv’d,
_every_ fierce conflict,
Ecgtheow’s son,
_every_ valorous work,
until that one day,	[4790]
when he against _the_ worm
must proceed.
Went then with xii. others,
with anger swollen,
_the_ Goths’ lord,
_the_ dragon to behold;
_he_ had then learn’d
whence the hostility arose,
baleful enmity of warriors;
for his bane to him had come	[4800]
_the_ fam’d precious vessel,
through the discoverer’s hand,
who in that band was
_the_ thirteenth man,
who of that strife
_the_ beginning caus’d;
_he_ had _a_ sad mind,
he must humble thence
_the_ plain point out:
against _his_ will he went,	[4810]
because that he _the_ earth-hall
alone knew,
the mound under the earth,
to _the_ sea-raging near,
_the_ strife of waves,		{162/163}
it was full within
of ornaments and wires;
_a_ monstrous guardian,
_a_ ready bold warrior,
held _the_ golden treasures,	[4820]
old, under _the_ earth:
that was no easy bargain
to obtain
for any man.
Sat then on _the_ ness
_the_ bold warrior king,
while _he_ bade farewell
to _his_ hearth-enjoyers,
_the_ Goths’ gold-friend:
his mind was sad,	[4830]
wandering and death-bound,
_the_ fate close at hand,
which the aged _man_
must greet,
must seek _his_ soul-treasure,
asunder part
life from body:
not then long was
the prince’s life
wrapt in flesh.	[4840]
Beowulf spake,
Ecgtheow’s son:
"I in youth many
war-onslaughts have outliv’d,
hours of warfare;
I all that remember:
I was seven winters _old_,
when me _the_ lord of treasures,		{163/164}
_the_ noble friend of nations,
from my father took,
held and had me	[4851]
Hrethel _the_ king;
gave me treasure and feasting,
of _our_ kinship was mindful;
I was not to him in life
in aught more unwelcome,
a warrior in his burghs,
than any of his children,
Herebeald and Hæthcyn,
or my Hygelac.	[4860]
For the eldest was
unbecomingly,
by his brother’s deed,
_the_ death-bed strew’d,
when Hæthcyn him
from _his_ horn’d bow,
his lord _and_ friend,
with _a_ shaft laid low;
_he_ miss’d _his_ mark,
and his kinsman shot,	[4870]
_one_ brother another,
with _a_ bloody arrow:
that was _a_ priceless fight,
criminally perpetrated,
heart-wearying to the soul:
yet nathless must
_the_ prince unavenged
lose _his_ life;
so sad it is,		{164/165}
for _an_ aged man	[4880]
to await
that his child hang
young on _the_ gallows:
then may he _a_ lay recite,
_a_ sorrowful song,
when his son hangs
for solace to _the_ raven,
and he him help may not,
old and feeble,
any afford:	[4890]
ever will _he_ be reminded,
every morning,
of _his_ offspring’s death;
another _he_ cares not
to await
within _his_ burghs,
_another_ heir,
when the one has,
through death’s necessity,
_his_ deeds expiated.	[4900]
_He_ sees sorrow-anxious
in his son’s bower
_the_ wine-hall desert,
wind-rush’d,
of _the_ rote bereft:
hanging sleeps
_the_ warrior in darkness;
there is no sound of harp,
_no_ mirth in _the_ courts,
as there were of old.	[4910]	{165/166}	XXXV.
Then passes he to songs,
_a_ sad lay sings,
one after one:
all seem’d to him too spacious,
_the_ plains and habitation.
Thus _the_ Weders’ helm,
after Herebealde,
heart’s sorrow
boiling bore;
_he_ in no wise might,	[4920]
on the murderer
_the_ feud avenge;
nor the sooner he the warrior
could hate
with hostile deeds,
although _he_ was not dear to him.
He then with that sorrow,
when him that pain befel,
gave up _the_ joy of men,
chose God’s light,	[4930]
to _his_ offspring left
(as does _a_ prosperous man)
land and native city,
when he from life departed.
Then was sin and strife
of Swedes and Goths,
over _the_ wide water		{166/167}
dissension common,
cruel war-hate,
after Hrethel died,	[4940]
or to him Ongentheow’s
sons were
* * *
* * *
bold martial leaders,
peace would not
over _the_ water hold,
but around Hreosna-beorh
dire artifice
oft perpetrated;	[4950]
that my kinsmen
avenged,
the enmity and crime,
as _it_ was well known,
although one [of them]
with his life _it_ bought,
a hard bargain:
for Hæthcyn was,
_the_ Goths’ lord,
war not idle.	[4960]
Then on _the_ morrow, I heard,
that _the_ other kinsman
with falchion’s edge
stole on _the_ slayer:		{167/168}
there [was] Ongentheow
sated with Eofor’s enmity,
_his_ war-helm glided off;
_the_ aged Scylfing
fell pale:
_yet_ did _his_ hand remember	[4970]
_the_ feud full well,
nor withdrew _the_ fatal stroke.
I him the treasures,
that he had given me,
paid in warfare,
as was granted me,
with _my_ bright sword.
He gave me land,
a paternal home’s delight;
he had no want,	[4980]
_so_ that he among Gifthas,
or Gar-Danes,
or in Sweden,
needed seek,
_a_ worse warrior
buy with value.
Thus in _the_ host I
would before him _go_,
alone in front,
and so while living shall	[4990]
conflict engage in,
while this sword endures,
which me early and late
has oft bestead,
since I valorously
of Dæghrefn was		{168/169}
_the_ slayer,
_the_ Hugas’ champion;
not the decoration he
to _the_ Frisian king,	[5000]
_the_ breast-honour,
might bring,
but in battle sank
_the_ standard’s guardian,
_the_ noble valorously.
I slew _him_ not with _the_ sword,
but in battle grasp’d his
heart’s throbbings,
the bone-house brake.
Now shall _the_ falchion’s edge,	[5010]
_the_ hand and hard sword,
for _the_ hoard do battle.”
Beowulf spake,
words of threat utter’d
for _the_ last time:
“I have dar’d many
battles in _my_ youth;
I will yet,
_a_ sage guardian of _my_ people,
_a_ conflict seek,	[5020]
gloriously accomplish,
if me _the_ atrocious spoiler
from _his_ earth-hall
will seek out.”
_He_ then greeted
each of _the_ men,
_the_ bold helm-bearer,		{169/170}
for _the_ last time,
_his_ dear companions:
“I would not bear _a_ sword,	[5030]
nor weapon to _the_ worm,
if I knew how
against the miserable being
I might else
with gripe grasp at _him_,
as I of old against Grendel did;
but I there intense fire,
hot, expect,
fierce and venomous;
therefore I will have on me	[5040]
shield and byrnie:
I will not [me] _the_ guardian of _the_ mount
[suffer] to fly over
[not] _a_ foot’s step;
but to us _it_ shall be at _the_ mound
as fate shall to us decree,
_the_ lord of every man,
I am in mind resolute,
so that I against the war-fly
lay aside vaunt.	[5050]
Await ye on _the_ mount
with byrnies protected,
_ye_ men, in arms,
which may _the_ better,
after _the_ fatal onslaught,
from wound escape		{170/171}
of us two.
_It_ is no enterprise of yours,
nor of _a_ common man,
(of _none_ save me alone)	[5060]
that he against _the_ miserable being
labours share,
stoutness prove.
I with valour shall
obtain _the_ gold,
or war shall take,
fierce, deadly bale,
your lord.”
Arose then by _his_ shield
the renown’d champion,	[5070]
bold beneath _his_ helm;
_he_ bore _his_ war-sark
under _the_ stony cliffs,
_he_ trusted in _the_ strength
of _a_ single man:
such is no coward’s enterprise.
_He_ saw then by _the_ mound
(he who a number, —
for _his_ bounties good, —
of battles had escap’d from,	[5080]
tumults of war,
when hosts assail)
_a_ stone arch stand,
_and_ a stream out thence
break from _the_ mount;
_the_ boiling of that bourn was		{171/172}
with intense fires hot;
_he_ might not near to _the_ board
unburn’d
for any while	[5090]
deep dive,
for _the_ dragon’s flame.
Let then from _his_ breast,
as be was incensed,
_the_ Weder-Goths’ lord
words issue forth.
_The_ stout of heart storm’d;
_the_ voice enter’d
sounding loudly clear,
under _the_ hoar stone.	[5100]
_His_ hate was rous’d,
the hoard-ward recogniz’d
the voice of man.
No more time was there
to demand peace;
first came forth
_the_ miserable being’s breath
out of _the_ rock,
hot sweat of battle:
_the_ earth resounded,	[5110]
burn’d under _the_ mount;
_his_ shield’s disc turn’d
against the grisly guest,
_the_ Goths’ lord.
Then was _the_ ring-bow’d’s
heart excited
to seek _the_ conflict:
_his_ sword had before drawn		{172/173}
_the_ good warlike king,
_an_ ancient relic,	[5120]
of edges not dull:
to either was
of _the_ bale-intention’d
fear from the other:
stubborn of mood stood
against _his_ towering shield
_the_ Weders’ prince;
then the worm bent
quickly together;
(be in arms awaited :)	[5130]
went then burning
bow’d departing,
hastening to _his_ fate.
_The_ shield-wall secur’d
_the_ life and body
for _a_ less while
of _the_ great prince
than his mind sought,
if he the time
at early day	[5140]
might have commanded:
so fate ordain’d not for him.
Fierce in conflict,
rais’d his hand
_the_ Goths’ lord,
_the_ grisly variegated _monster_ struck		{173/174}
with Inge’s relic,
_so_ that _the_ edge fail’d,
_the_ brown _falchion_ on _the_ bone
bit less strongly	[5150]
than its great king
had need,
oppress’d with labours.
Then was _the_ mount’s guardian
after _the_ mighty stroke,
in a fierce mood;
_he_ cast deadly fire,
widely sprung
the rays of conflict:
the fierce conqueror boasted not,	[5160]
_the_ Goths’ gold-friend,
his battle-falchion fail’d,
(not good at need,)
as it sgould not,
_an_ iron primely good;
that was no easy enterprize;
that the great
son of Ecgtheow
_the_ earth-plain
would give up,	[5170]
that he should spontaneously
a dwelling inbabit
elsewhere.
So must every man
leave these transitory days.
Nor was it then long until,		{174/175}
that those fell beings
again each other met;
had recruited himself _the_ hoard-ward,
_his_ breast heav’d with breathing,	[5180]
with new energy;
suffer’d distress,
by fire encompass’d,
he who had ere _a_ people rul’d:
not in _a_ body him
_his_ hand-companions,
sons of nobles
stood around,
in warlike bands;
but they to _the_ wood retir’d,	[5190]
their life to save:
in one of them boil’d
_his_ mind with sorrows:
kinship can never
aught pervert
in him who rightly thinks.			XXXVI.
Wiglaf was hight
Weoxstan’s son,
_a_ belov’d shield-warrior,
_a_ Scylfings’ lord,	[5200]
ÆIfhere’s kinsman:
_he_ saw his liege lord
under _his_ martial helm
heat suffering:		{175/176}
_he_ then call’d to mind the possession
that he had formerly given him,
_the_ wealthy dwelling-place
of _the_ Waegmundings,
every public right,
as his father had possess’d.	[5210]
_He_ could not then refrain,
_but_ grasp’d _his_ shield,
_the_ yellow-linden,
drew _his_ ancient sword,
that among men was
_a_ relic of Eanmund,
Ohthere’s son,
of whom in conflict was,
_when_ a friendless exile,
Weohstan _the_ slayer,	[5220]
with falchion’s edges,
and from his kinsmen bore away,
_the_ brown-hued helm,
_the_ ringed byrnie,
_the_ old eotenish sword,
which him _Onela_ had given,
his companion’s
battle-weeds,
ready martial gear:	[5229]
_he_ spake not of the feud,
although he his brother’s child
had exil’d.
He _the_ armour held
many years,
_the_ falchion and byrnie.		{176/177}
until his son might
_some_ valorous deed achieve,
as his father erst:
_he_ gave him then among _the_ Goths
of war-weeds	[5240]
every kind numberless;
then he from life departed
aged on _his_ way forth.
Then was _the_ first time
for _the_ young champion,
that he _a_ war-onslaught
with his noble lord
should achieve:
nor did his courage melt,
nor his kinsman’s legacy	[5250]
fail in _the_ contest;
that the worm found,
when they together
had come.
Wiglaf spake
many sentences,
said to _his_ comrades,
(his mind was sad:)
“I that time remember,
as we were drinking mead,	[5260]
when we promis’d
our lord
in _the_ beer-hall,
who gave us these rings,
that we him the war equipments
would repay,
if him such-like		{177/178}
need befel,
_the_ helms and hard swords,
when us in his band he chose
for this expedition,	[5271]
of his own accord,
reminded us of glories,
and me presents gave,
because he us warriors
good accounted,
bold helm-bearers:
although our lord
this bold work
thought alone	[5280]
to perform,
_the_ people’s guardian,
because he of _all_ men most
glories had achiev’d,
rash deeds.
Now is the day come
that our liege lord
has need of might,
of good warriors:
let us advance	[5290]
to help _the_ warlike leader,
while be hot
_the_ fierce fiery terror.
God knows in me,
that to me _it_ is far preferable
that my body,
with my gold-giver,
fire should clasp:		{178/179}
_it_ seems to me not fitting
that we _our_ shields bear	[5300]
back to _our_ home,
unless we before may
fell _the_ foe,
_the_ life defend
of _the_ Weders’ prince.
I well know
that _his_ old deserts were not _such_,
that he alone should
of the flower of the Goths
tribulation suffer,	[5310]
sink in conflict:
for us two shall sword and helm,
byrnie and martial garb,
to both _be_ common;
_he_ then waded through the deadly reek.
Wiglaf _his_ courage bare
to _his_ lord’s aid;
few words _he_ said:
“Dear Beowulf,
perform all well,	[5320]
as thou in youthful life
long since didst say,
that thou wouldst let not,
while thou didst live,
_thy_ greatness sink:
_thou_ shalt now, for deeds renown’d,		{179/180}
_a_ resolute prince,
with all might
_thy_ life defend:
I will support thee.”	[5330]
After those words
_the_ worm came angry,
_the_ fell, guileful guest,
_a_ second time,
with fire-boilings colour’d,
_his_ foes to visit,
_the_ hostile men:
with flame-waves was burnt
_the_ broad war-disk;
_the_ byrnie might not	[5340]
to _the_ young warrior
aid afford;
but _the_ young man
under his kinsman’s shield
valorously went,
when bis own was
by _the_ gleeds consum’d.
Then again _the_ warlike king
_his_ glories call’d to mind,
with main strength struck	[5350]
with _his_ battle falchion,
_so_ that on _the_ head it stood
by hate impell’d;
Nægling snapt asunder,
fail’d in the conflict,
Beowulf’s sword,		{180/181}
_an_ ancient and grey brand:
it was not granted him
that him iron
edges might	[5360]
in battle help:
the hand was too strong,
which every falchion,
as I have heard,
by its stroke overpower’d,
although he to _the_ contest bore
a weapon wondrously hard,
_yet_ ’twas naught for him the better.
Then was _the_ great destroyer,
_a_ third time,	[5370]
_the_ fell fire-drake,
mindful of enmities;
_he_ rush’d on the renown’d _chief_,
then him amply requited,
hot and fiercely grim
_his_ whole neck _he_ clasp’d
with _his_ horrid bones:
he ensanguin’d was
with life-gore;
_the_ blood in waves bubbled.	[5380]		XXXVII.
Then I have learn’d _that_ at need
of _the_ great king		{181/182}
_the_ warrior earl
valour manifested,
craft and courage,
as to him was natural:
he heeded not the head,
but the hand burn’d
of _the_ bold man,
that he might his kinsman help;
then he the hostile guest	[5391]
somewhat lower struck,
_the_ warrior in arms,
_so_ that _the_ sword div’d
blood-stain’d and ornate,
_so_ that the fire began
afterwards to abate;
then again _the_ king himself
got command of his senses,
drew _his_ deadly knife,	[5400]
bitter and battle-sharp,
that he on _his_ byrnie bore:
_the_ Weders’ protector scor’d
_the_ worm in _the_ middle,
fell’d the foe,
avenged _his_ deadly ardour,
and they him then both
had destroy’d,
_the_ kindred princes:
such should a warrior be,
_a_ thane at need.	[5411]	{182/183}
That to the prince was
_a_ victorious moment of _his_ enterprize,
by his own deeds,
of _his_ worldly work.
Then the wound began,
that him the earth-drake
erst had wrought,
to burn and swell.
He soon found	[5420]
that in his breast
baleful harm boil’d,
venom, within:
then _the_ prince went,
_so_ that he by _the_ mound,
wisely thinking,
sat on _a_ seat;
look’d on _the_ giants’ work,
how the stone arches,
on pillars fast,	[5430]
the eternal earth-house
held within.
Him then with _his_ hand
_the_ battle-gory
great prince,
_the_ thane infinitely good,
his liege lord,
with water lav’d,
_him_ with conflict sated,
and his health allur’d.	[5440]
Beowulf spake,
of _his_ wound he said,		{183/184}
_his_ wound deadly livid;
_he_ knew well,
that he _his_ day-moments
had pass’d through,
_his_ joy of earth;
then was departed all
of his days’ number,
death immediately nigh:	[5450]
“I to my son now
would give
_my_ war-weeds,
if so granted me
any heir
were after _me_,
belonging to _my_ body.
I have this people rul’d
fifty winters;
_there_ has been no nation’s king	[5460]
of _those_ surrounding,
_not_ any of them,
who me in martial strifes
durst greet,
with terror serve.
In _my_ land I have sustain’d
vicissitudes;
held my _own_ well,
sought no treacheries,
nor swore many	[5470]
oaths unrighteously.
I for all this may,		{184/185}
sick with, mortal wounds,
have joy;
because upbraid me need not
_the_ Ruler of men
_with the_ deadly bale of kinsmen,
when shall depart my
life from _its_ body.
Now go thou quickly	[5480]
_the_ hoard to view
under _the_ hoar stone,
Wiglaf dear;
now the worm lies,
sleeps sorely wounded,
of _his_ treasure bereft:
be now in haste,
that I _the_ ancient wealth,
_the_ gold-treasure, may perceive,
well behold	[5490]
_the_ jewels, curious gems,
that I the softer may,
after _the_ treasure- wealth,
resign my
life and people,
that I long have held.”			XXXVIII.
Then heard I _that_ quickly
Wihstan’s son,
after _these_ verbal sayings,
_his_ wounded lord	[5500]
obeyed, mortally sick;
bore _his_ ringed net,		{185/186}
_his_ twisted war-sark,
under _the_ mount’s roof.
Saw then in victory exulting,
as be went by _the_ seat,
_the_ bold kindred thane,
treasure-jewels many,
gold glittering,
heavy on the ground,	[5510]
wonders in _the_ mound,
and the worm’s den,
_the_ old twilight flyer’s,
dishes standing,
vessels of men of yore,
foodless,
_their_ ornaments fall’n off:
there was many a _helm_
old and rusty,
armlets many	[5520]
cunningly fasten’d:
(treasure easily may
gold in _the_ earth,
every one of human race
despise,
hide it who will :)
he also saw bang heavily
_an_ ensign all golden
high o’er _the_ hoard,
of band-wonders greatest,	[5530]
lock’d by arts of song,
from which _there_ stood a ray,		{186/187}
_so_ that he the ground-surface
might perceive,
_the_ wonder over-scan.
Not of the worm was there
appearance any,
for him had _the_ edge destroy’d.
Then heard I _that_ in _the_ mound
_the_ hoard had robb’d,	[5540]
_the_ old giants’ work,
one man,
in his bosom loaded
cups and dishes,
at his own will;
_an_ ensign also took,
of signs brightest,
_a_ falchion brass-shod,
_the_ edge was iron;
_the_ old lord’s,	[5550]
who of those treasures
had been _the_ guardian
_a_ long while;
fire-dread _he_ bore
hot before _the_ hoard,
fiercely boiling,
at midnights,
until he by murder died.
_The_ messenger was in haste,
desirous of return,	[5560]
by _the_ ornaments accelerated:
him curiosity brake,
whether _the_ bold warrior
_he_ should living find		{187/188}
on the field,
_the_ Weders’ prince,
valour-sick,
where he before had left him.
He with the treasures then
_the_ great prince,	[5570]
his lord,
found gory,
at life’s end:
he again began him
with water to sprinkle,
until _the_ word’s point
brake through _the_ treasure of _his_ breast.
_The_ aged _man_ in sorrow
_the_ gold beheld:
“I, for those ornaments,	[5580]
thanks to _the_ Lord for all,
_the_ Glory-king,
in words say,
_the_ Lord eternal,
which I here gaze on;
because I have been able,
for my people,
ere _my_ death-day,
such to acquire:
now I for _the_ treasures’ hoard	[5590]
have prudently sold
my life-flame:
perform ye now
_the_ people’s need:
I may here no longer be		{188/189}
command _the_ warlike brave
_a_ mound to make
bright after _the_ pile,
at _the_ sea’s naze,
which shall for _a_ remembrance	[5600]
to my people
tower on high
on Hrones-næs;
that it sea-farers
afterwards may call
Beowulf’s mount,
those who _their_ foamy barks
over _the_ mists of floods
drive from afar.”
Doff’d _then_ from his neck	[5610]
_a_ golden ring
_the_ bold-hearted prince,
to _his_ thane gave it,
to _the_ young javelin-warrior,
_his_ gold-hued helm,
_his_ ring and byrnie;
bade him use _them_ well:
“Thou art _the_ last remnant
of our race,
of _the_ Wægmundings;	[5620]
fate has swept away all
my kinsmen
to _the_ Godhead,
earls in _their_ valour:
I shall follow them.”
That was _the_ aged _chieftain’s_
latest word,		{189/190}
from _his_ breast’s thoughts,
ere he chose _the_ pile,
hot intense flames:	[5630]
from his bosom departed
_his_ soul, to seek
_the_ doom of _the_ just.			XXXIX.
Then _it_ befel
_the_ youthful man
sorely,
that on _the_ earth he saw
his dearest _friend_
at life’s end
livid appearing;	[5640]
_his_ slayer in like manner lay,
_the_ formidable earth-drake,
of life bereft,
by bale compell’d;
_his_ ring-hoards longer
_the_ crook-bent worm
might not command;
for from him iron
edges had taken _them_ away,
hard, war-sharp,	[5650]
_the_ hammer’s legacies;
_so_ that the wide-flyer
with wounds still
had fall’n on _the_ earth,
nigh to _the_ hoard-house,		{190/191}
not along _the_ air
sporting went _he_
at midnights;
of _his_ treasures proud,
showed _his_ countenance;	[5660]
but to earth he fell
before the war-chief’s
handiwork.
Yet in _the_ land
few men have thriven
possessing might,
as I have heard,
although he in every deed
were daring,
if he against _a_ venomous destroyer’s	[5670]
breath rush’d,
or _his_ ring-hall
with hands disturb’d,
if he waking
found _the_ guardian
dwelling in _the_ mount.
By Beowulf was
_his_ share of noble treasures
with death paid for;
_he_ had to each	[5680]
_an_ end brought
of _this_ transitory life.
’Twas then not long until,
that the battle-tardy _ones_
left _the_ holt,		{191/192}
dastardly faith-breakers,
ten together,
who durst not before
with javelins play,
at their liege lord’s	[5690]
great need;
but they ashamed
bare _their_ shields,
_their_ war-weeds,
to where the aged _warrior_ lay
looking on Wiglaf.
He wearied sat,
_the_ active champion,
near _his_ lord’s shoulders,
quicken’d him with water;	[5700]
he no whit succeeded,
he might not on earth,
though he had given wealth,
in _the_ chieftain
life retain,
nor the Almighty’s
will avert;
_the_ doom of God would
in deeds rule
over every man,	[5710]
as it now yet does.
Then was from the youth
_a_ fierce answer
easily gotten
for him who had before his rage lost.
Wiglaf spake,		{192/193}
Weohstan’s son,
_the_ warrior sorrowful in soul
look’d on _the_ odious _cowards_:
"Lo, that may say	[5720]
who truth will speak,
that the liege lord,
who to you those treasures gave
_the_ martial gear,
in which ye there stand;
(when he on _the_ ale-bench
often gave
to _the_ hall-sitters
helm and byrnie,
_the_ prince to his thanes,	[5730]
such as he most valiant
anywhere far or near
might find ;)
that he totally
_those_ war-weeds,
_his_ defence, cast away,
when him war should overtake.
_The_ people’s king
of _his_ comrades in arms
needed not to boast;	[5740]
yet did God grant him,
_the_ Ruler of victories,
that he himself avenged
alone with edge,
when he had need of valour.
I to him life-support
could little
give in _the_ conflict,		{193/194}
and yet _I_ undertook
above my means	[5750]
to help _my_ kinsman:
ever was _I_ the worse,
when with _my_ sword I struck
_the_ deadly foe,
_the_ fire ran stronger,
boil’d from _his_ entrails:
defenders too few
throng’d round _their_ prince,
when the calamity came on him.
Now shall _the_ partaking of treasure	[5760]
and gift of swords,
all joy of country,
to your beloved
kindred fail:
of land-right must
of the tribe
every man
wander void,
after nobles
from afar shall hear of	[5770]
your flight,
_your_ inglorious deed.
Death is better
for every man
than _a_ life of reproach.”			XL.
_He_ bade then the mighty work
at _the_ enclosure be announced,		{194/195}
up on _the_ ocean’s shore,
where the warrior band,
_the_ livelong day,	[5780]
sad of mood, sat,
shield-bearers,
of both in expectation,
of _the_ day’s end,
and of _the_ return
of _the_ dear man.
Little was he silent
of _the_ new intelligence
who to _the_ ness rode;
but he truly	[5790]
said of all:
“Now is _the_ kind giver
of _the_ Weders’ people,
_the_ Goths’ lord,
on _his_ death-bed fast:
_he_ rests on _his_ fatal couch,
through _the_ worm’s deeds;
by him lies
_his_ deadly adversary,
with knife-wounds sick:	[5800]
with _his_ sword _he_ could not
on the fell being
by any means
cause _a_ wound.
Wiglaf sits
over Beowulf,
Wihstan’s son,
_one_ warrior over another
lifeless _one_;
holds with weary spirit	[5810]	{195/196}
chief ward
over friend and foe.
Now to _the_ people is expectation
of _a_ time of war,
after among [both]
Franks and Frisians
_the_ king’s fall
becomes widely _known_.
The quarrel was form’d
fierce against _the_ Hugas,	[5820]
after Hygelac came
faring with _a_ naval force
to Friesland,
where him _the_ Hetwaras
in war vanquish’d,
boldly went
with over-might,
_so_ that _the_ mail’d warrior
must bow;
_he_ fell in _his_ host,	[5380]
no martial gear gave
_the_ prince to _his_ warriors.
To us has been ever since
_the_ Mere-Wioings’
mercy denied.
Nor _do_ I with _the_ Swedish people
_of_ peace or faith
aught expect;
for _it_ was widely known
that Ongentheow	[5840]
had of life depriv’d		{196/197}
Hæthcyn, Hrethel’s son,
by Hrefna-wood,
when in _their_ pride
first sought
_the_ Goths’ people
_the_ warlike Scylfings.
Forthwith him the venerable
father of Ohthere,
old and terrific,	[5850]
_a_ hand-blow gave;
_the_ sea-leader bore away
from _the_ bridal hearth,
_the_ old _warrior_, long since, _the_ maid
with gold adorn’d,
Onela’s mother,
and Ohthere’s;
and then pursued
_his_ deadly enemies,
until they escap’d	[5860]
with difficulty
into Hrefnes-holt,
lordless.
Beset then _the_ naval force
_the_ sword’s leaving,		{197/198}
with wounds weary:
woe _he_ oft promis’d
to _the_ miserable progeny,
_the_ livelong night;
said _that_ he _them_ at morn,	[5870]
with falchion’s edges
would greet,
some _hang_ on gallows-trees,
[to _the_ birds] for sport.
Comfort afterwards came to
_the_ sad of mood,
together ere day,
when they Hygelac’s
horns and trumpets
sounding perceiv’d,	[5880]
when the good _king_ came,
with _the_ flower of _his_ people,
marching on _their_ track.			XLI.
Was the bloody trace
of Swedes and Goths,
_the_ deadly rush of men,
widely seen;
how the people with them
enmity excited,
Departed then the good _king_	[5890]
with his associates,		{198/199}
sage _and_ much sad,
_the_ fastness to seek.
_The_ warrior Ongentheow
had proceeded higher;
_he_ of Hygelac’s
warfare had heard,
_the_ proud _chief’s_ war-craft;
yet believ’d not
that he _the_ seamen	[5900]
could repel,
_from the_ traversers of _the_ deep
_his_ hoard defend,
_his_ children and bride.
Withdrew again thence
_the_ aged _chief_ under _the_ earth wall.
Then was wealth announced
to _the_ Swedes’ people,
_the_ banner of Hygelac,
the peaceful plain.	[5910]
_The_ ford _they_ went over,
after _the_ Hrethlings		{199/200}
had to _the_ entrenchment throng’d.
There was Ongentheow,
with swords’ edges,
the grizzly-hair’d,
in _that_ conflict punish’d,
_so_ that the great king
must submit to
Eofer’s sole doom.	[5920]
Him angrily
“Wolf, Wonred’s son,
with _his_ weapon reach’d,
_so_ that, for _the_ blow, his
blood sprang from _the_ veins,
forth under _his_ locks:
yet was he not afraid,
_the_ aged Scylfing,
but requited quickly,
with _a_ worse exchange,	[5930]
that deadly onslaught,
when _the_ great king
turn’d thitherward;
nor could the swift
son of Wonred
to the old warrior
_a_ hand-stroke give:
for he on his head
_the_ helm clave previously,
so that he blood-stain’d	[5940]
must bow:		{200/201}
_he_ fell on _the_ earth,
yet was he not doom’d;
but he recover’d himself,
though _the_ wound had touch’d him.
Caus’d _then_ the fierce
thane of Hygelac
_his_ broad falchion,
as his brother lay,
_his_ old eotenish sword,	[5950]
_the_ giant helm
to break o’er the shield-wall:
then sank [the] king,
_the_ people’s shepherd,
his life was stricken.
Then were many
who his kinsman bound,
quickly rais’d,
when it was clear’d for them,
_so_ that they _the_ slaughter-place	[5960]
might command,
while stript
_one_ warrior another.
_They_ took from Ongentheow
_his_ iron byrnie,
_his_ hilted hard sword,
and his helm also;
_the_ hoar _warrior’s_ trapping
_they_ to Hygelac bore.	[5969]
[He the] war-gear receiv’d.		{201/202}
and them promis’d fair
rewards among _the_ people,
and so perform’d:
requited _the_ martial onslaught
_the_ Goths’ lord,
Hrethel’s offspring,
when to _his_ home he came,
to Eofer and Wulf with _him_;
he besides treasures gave,
to each of them,	[5980]
_a_ hundred thousand
of land and closed rings:
nor needed to reproach them for those rewards
_any_ one on mid-earth,
since they those honours had in battle won;
and then _he_ to Eofer gave
_his_ only daughter,
_an_ honour to _his_ home,
as _a_ pledge of favour.
That is the feud	[5990]
and the enmity,
_the_ deadly hate of men;
whence I expect
that us will seek
_the_ Swedes’ people,
when they shall learn		{202/203}
our lord _is_
lifeless,
who had before defended,
against enemies,	[6000]
treasure and realm,
_and_, after _the_ fall of heroes,
the bold Scyldings;
public right establish’d,
or yet further,
valorous deeds perform’d.
Now is speed best,
that we _the_ great king
there behold,
and bring him	[6010]
who gave us rings
on _the_ way to _the_ pile:
there shall not aught of _any_ one
be consum’d with the bold _king_;
for there is _a_ hord of treasures,
gold without number,
cruelly purchas’d;
and now at last,
with _his_ own life.
_he_ has bought rings;	[6020]
these shall fire devour,
flame cover,
no warrior _shall_ bear
_a_ treasure in remembrance,
nor maiden fair		{203/204}
have on _her_ neck
_a_ ring-honour;
but shall, sad of mood,
of gold bereft,
often not once,	[6030]
_a_ strange land tread;
now _the_ martial leader
has ceas’d from laughter,
sport and joy of song;
therefore shall _the_ javelin be,
many _a_ morning cold,
not by hands brandish’d,
_nor_ rais’d in hand;
no sound of harp
_shall the_ warrior raise;	[6040]
but the dusk raven,
eager o’er _the_ fallen,
much shall tell,
_shall_ to _the_ eagle say
how _it_ with him at _his_ foodsped.
while with _the_ wolf he
spoil’d _the_ slain.”
Thus the bold warrior
was speaking
unwelcome speeches;	[6050]
he falsified not much
of events or words.
_The_ band all arose,
went unblithe
under Earna-næs,
(_their_ tears bubbled forth)		{204/205}
the wonder to view.
_They_ then found on _the_ sand
soulless,
holding _his_ couch,	[6060]
him who had given them rings
in earlier times:
then was _the_ end-day
for _the_ good _chief_ gone,
_so_ that the war king,
the Weders’ prince,
_a_ wondrous death should die
but they there saw
_a_ stranger thing,
_the_ worm on _the_ plain,	[6070]
_the_ adverse _one_ there,
_the_ hostile, lying;
the fire-drake was,
_the_ grim horror,
with gleeds scorch’d;
he was fifty
feet of measure
long on _his_ bed:
_he the_ delight of air enjoy’d
in _the_ night’s hours,	[6080]
again came down
_his_ den to visit:
_he_ was then fast in death;
_he_ had of _his_ earth-dens
_the_ end enjoy’d;
by him stood
cups and bowls;		{205/206}
dishes lay _there_,
and costly swords
rusty, eaten through,	[6090]
as if they in _the_ lap of earth
_a_ thousand winters
had there continued:
for that heritage was
exceedingly strong,
_the_ gold of men of old,
encircled by enchantment,
so that that ring-hall
might not touch
any man,	[6100]
unless God himself,
true King of victories,
should give _it_ to whom he would
(He is _the_ well-willer of men)
_the_ hoard to open,
just to whatever man
as might to him seem meet.			XLII.
Then was seen
that fortune favour’d not
him who unrighteously	[6110]
within had hidden
treasure, under _the_ mound.
_The_ guardian had before slain
some of a few,
then was the quarrel
wrothfully avenged.
What wonder when		{206/207}
_a_ brave renown’d warrior
to _the_ end journey
of living creatures,	[6120]
when long may not
_a_ man with his kinsmen
_the_ mead-bench occupy?
So ’twas to Beowulf;
when he _the_ mount’s guardian
sought, his guileful hate,
himself knew not
through what his parting from _the_ world
should be,
_or_ how it till doomsday
solemnly declar’d
_those_ great princes,
who there that treasure put,
that the man should be
with sins guilty,
with harryings hemm’d in,
in hell-bonds fast,
by terrors punish’d,
who should that plain despoil.
He was not covetous of gold:	[6140]
more readily had _he_
_the_ owner’s favour
previously purchas’d.
Wiglaf spake,
Wihstan’s son:
“Oft must _a_ man many,		{207/208}
for the sake of one,
hardships suffer,
as has befallen us.
We could not inculcate on
_our_ dear prince,	[6151]
the realm’s guardian,
any counsel,
that he should not assail
that gold-ward;
_but_ let him lie
where he long had been,
in _his_ habitation continue,
till _the_ world’s end,
hold _the_ high appointment.	[6160]
_The_ hoard has been seen,
cruelly acquir’d.
Too powerful was that grant,
which impell’d him thither.
I was therein,
and it all look’d over,
_the_ house’s furniture,
when _it_ was clear’d for me;
not pleasantly
the way permitted	[6170]
in under _the_ earth-mound;
I in haste seiz’d
with _my_ hands _a_ great
mighty burthen
of hoard-acquisitions,
bare _them_ out hither
to my king;
_he_ was yet living,		{208/209}
wise and sensible;
very many _things_ said	[6180]
_the_ aged prince in sadness.
and bade me greet you,
pray’d that ye would make,
befitting _our_ friend’s deeds,
in _the_ pile’s stead,
_a_ lofty mount,
great and glorious,
as he of _all_ men was
_the_ worthiest warrior
widely throughout _the_ earth,	[6190]
while he _the_ wealth of cities
might enjoy.
Let us now hasten,
other * *
to see and seek
_the_ curious mass,
_the_ wonders beneath the mound.
I will guide you,
_so_ that enough ye
will not gaze on	[6200]
rings and broad gold.
Let the bier be ready,
quickly made,
when we come out,
and then bear
our lord,
_the_ dear man
_to_ where he long shall
in the All-powerful’s
care endure.”	[6210]
Bade then command
Wihstan’s son,		[209/210]
_the_ human war-beast,
many men,
house-owning,
that they pile-wood
from afar should convey,
folk-owning,
towards _the_ good _prince_:
“Now shall _the_ gleed devour,	[6220]
_the_ dusky flame destroy,
_the_ prince of warriors,
him who oft awaited
_the_ iron shower;
_who_ when _the_ storm of shafts,
from strings impell’d,
pass’d o’er _the_ shield-wall,
_the_ shaft-notch held,
_when_, prompt with _its_ feather-gear,
_the_ fall of arrows went.”	[6230]
Forthwith the prudent
son of Wihstan
call’d from _the_ band
king’s thanes
seven together
the choicest,
went himself _the_ eighth
under _the_ treacherous roof:
_a_ warrior
in _his_ hand bare	[6240]
a fire-brand,
who went at _the_ head.		{210/211}
_It_ was not then without lot
who should the hoard despoil,
when without _a_ guard
some deal
_the_ men saw
in _the_ hall remaining,
thinly scatter’d lying;
little regretted any,	[6250]
that with all speed they
might convey out
_the_ precious treasures;
_the_ dragon eke they shov’d,
_the_ worm, o’er _the_ wall-cliff,
let _the_ wave take,
_the_ flood embrace,
_the_ treasure’s guardian:
there was twisted gold
on _the_ wain laden,	[6260]
of every kind numberless;
_and the_ prince borne,
_the_ hoar warrior,
to Hrones-næs.			XLIII.
For him then prepar’d
_the_ Goths’ people
_a_ pile on _the_ earth,
_a_ mighty _one_,
with helmets hung,
war-boards.	[6270]	{211/212}
bright byrnies,
as he had requested.
Laid then in the midst
_the_ great prince
_the_ warriors lamenting,
_their_ beloved lord:
began then on _the_ mount,
of bale-fires _the_ greatest
the warriors to kindle:
_the_ wood-reek ascended	[6280]
swart from _the_ Swedish pine,
the roaring flame,
with weeping mingled,
(_the_ wind-blending ceas’d)
until it the bone-house
had broken,
hot on _the_ breast.
Sad in spirits
_they_ with mind-care bewail’d
_their_ liege lord’s death;	[6290]
as if _a_ mournful lay
* * *
* * *
sorrowing bound
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *
heaven swell’d with smoke.		{212/213}
Wrought then
_the_ Weders’ people
_a_ mound on _the_ hill;
it was high and broad,
by wave-farers
widely to be seen;
and constructed
in ten days	[6300]
_the_ renown’d warrior’s beacon,
* * *
with _a_ wall surrounding _it_,
as it most honourable
highly sagacious men
might find.
In _the_ mound they placed
rings and jewels,
also ornaments,
such as before in _the_ hoard	[6310]
hostile men
had taken.
_They_ left _the_ treasure of earls
to _the_ earth to hold,
gold in _the_ dust,
where it now yet remains
[to men] as useless
as it [ere] was.
Then round _the_ mound rode
war-beasts * *	[6320]
nobles * *
of all _the_ twelve
would * * speak
_their_ king bewail,		{213/214}
_a_ verbal lay recite,
and many things say;
esteem’d _his_ bravery,
and his valiant works
* * *
nobly judged,	[6330]
as it is fitting,
that _a_ man his liege lord
with _his_ words praise,
in _his_ soul love,
when he shall _go_ forth
from _the_ body,
* * become.
Thus deplor’d
_the_ Goths’ people
their lord’s fall,	[6340]
_his_ hearth-enjoyers;
said that he was
of world-kings,
of men, mildest,
and kindest,
to _his_ people gentlest,
and of praise most desirous.	[6347]
