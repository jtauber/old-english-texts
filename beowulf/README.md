# beowulf-data

`raw-data` contains the publicly-redistributable data I prepared for the Read Beowulf site when I was doing a Beowulf class.

The Brunetti analysis is CC-licensed and I have added vowel lengths from the Perseus text of Beowulf which is also CC-licensed.

`thorpe` consists of a corrected OCR of Benjamin Thorpe's line-by-line translation.

## Outline of `raw-data`

* `aligned.txt` is an attempt to align them. See `alignment.md` for details.
* `chapters.txt` is a list of line offsets for each chapter/Fitt.
* `brunetti.txt` is Brunetti's wonderful analysis and tagging of the text.
* `brunetti-length.txt` is my attempt to add vowel lengths (an additional column) using the Perseus text.

## Possible Things To Do

* adding more English translations
* doing alignments between the OE and translations
* adding diacritics for ġ, ċ, etc (which I'd made a start on)
* doing a more extensive morphological analysis of the kind I do for Greek
* some sequencing analysis of the kind I do for Greek
* turning Brunetti's syntactic tagging into more of a full dependency analysis
* doing some analysis of the alliteration
